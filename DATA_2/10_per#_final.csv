Starting in September hair loss seems significantly slowed down. That was 4 months past the vaccine. The good news is the hair seems to start to regrow though in my case it will be at least 4 or 5 years before it has its original length again. The bad news is that by now there is such severe damage done with more than 90% of hair lost that I may never recover and there are no legal means at least at this present time to hold those who have caused that accountable.

Up to this point I’ve had all Moderna shots (initial series and two boosters, last one being the Omicron booster last fall, which I also got with the flu shot).  For this new booster I had to get Pfizer due to availability issues.  Got it yesterday at 8:30 AM and I’m feeling almost completely normal 24 hours later.  I did have fatigue, some achiness and chills yesterday afternoon starting around 3 PM and lasting through most of the night but it was all soooo mild compared to my last booster experience.  I was so miserable for almost 3 days last time - even with ibuprofen and Tylenol.  Every Moderna shot I’ve had, except for the very first one, I’ve had these covid-like reactions to them that just sink me.  This year- hardly at all!  It’s so weird!

"**Abstract** Vaccines have been central in ending the COVID-19 pandemic, but newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants increasingly escape first-generation vaccine protection. To fill this gap, live particle-based vaccines mimicking natural infection aim at protecting against a broader spectrum of virus variants.  We designed “single-cycle SARS-CoV-2 viruses” (SCVs) that lack essential viral genes, possess superior immune-modulatory features and provide an excellent safety profile in the Syrian hamster model. Full protection of all intranasally vaccinated animals was achieved against an autologous challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus using an Envelope-gene-deleted vaccine candidate. By deleting key immune-downregulating genes, sterilizing immunity was achieved with an advanced candidate without virus spread to contact animals. Hence, SCVs have the potential to induce a broad and durable protection against COVID-19 superior to a natural infection.",2023-05-23 2:48

They’re expecting 40-80% of the population to contract the virus. You have to also factor in that the flu typically dies out in warmer weather and is only common in the winter months.

If you’re looking at 100-250+ million people with the virus then that 1.5-3% mortality rate looks a lot worse. You’re looking at millions of deaths.

And it would not be a bad idea to look back at that and establish how many those were exactly. Maybe those numbers could help prevent future death, maybe the investigation would find that it's suck cosmic bad luck that there is nothing to be done preventatively.   It would be good to have data that could be compared to other vaccines, like is the myocarditis thing something that happens more with MRNA vaccines or less than with something like the traditional flu shot?    That said, I have no confidence in the current FDA to produce anything remotely useful in this investigation...",2025-09-13 6:34

"I'm starting to wonder if this is vaccine related. After my first dose of Pfizer I has strange colorful visions before my eyes in a darkened room. It was very bright with motion. Looked like my vision was filled with small brightly colored squirming worms. It went away after a couple days. This was over 1 year ago.

Due to a problem with my arm I delayed my second dose to about 42 days. I got it and the same thing happened with my vision and the brightly colored squirming worms. It didn't affect my vision in the daylight or with lights on. I could only see it in the dark. But then something else happened. My left eye started getting stabbing pains, like in the eyeball itself not on the surface of the eye. I also started having some pain in my right eye as well. This is like deep aching pain and pain when I move my eyes.

Eventually it toned down and the weird visions went away as well. My partner and I had got vaccinated at the same time and so I described this issue with my eyes to him an he told me he had the same thing. Not the pain but the strange visual effects when closing his eyes at night or looking out into the dark. 

Well time went on to about 7 months after my second dose and everyone was saying we should get a booster. Due to the problems with my arms and the concern about the pain in my eyes I was very hesitant about a booster but I was nervous about COVID too since I'm older and have high risk conditions. So I got my booster and...nothing. There was no pain in my eyes and there was no strange visions. Just arm pain which eventually went away.

Well now it's 5 months later and for a while now I've had nearly constant pain in both my eyes as well as off and on of the strange visions. In addition to that and developing along at the same time I have had MASSIVE problems in my nose. Now I have allergies so I've always had problems with stuff sinuses and snott constantly running down my throat. It's just the nature of things with allwrgies, bit I have never in my life had constant sores inside my nose that bleed and won't heal.

I've also spent years of my life in my work looking at screens, and while my eyes do get tired at times they have never had this kind of pain and it's the same pain I had less than 24 hours after Pfizer 2. It became so bad I couldn't work or read. I went to an Opthalmologist to check my eyes and he told me he couldn't see anything wrong with them and suggested I must have a sinus infection.

Well I really doubt that. I have always had sinus problems because of the allergies and have never before had this kind of eye pain. To this day they are still in pain and I'm so frustrated with the sores in my nose that I've never had before. 

A couple weeks ago in desperation I started searching around online about what could be causing sores that won't heal inside the nose and deep eye soreness and pain. One answer I came across was HIV. And I thought...didn't I read something back in 2020 that SARSCoV2 has something in common with HIV? 

Well just today I was reading that it's some genetic code that's on the spike protein that allows cov2 to enter tcells. I mean this stuff is way over my head but all I know is that apparently it's also in the vaccines. And if HIV can cause sores that won't heal in the nose plus pain in the eyes then what has this vaccine done to my eyes and nose?

Of course I have no proof of any of this all I know is I've lived MANY years with allergies and sinus problems and nothing like this. My nose is on fire and I have trouble reading due to pain in my eyes. 

I should also mention that Ivery likely had covid in March 2020 bit was unable to get a test at that time so no proof of that either. 

One thing I'm worried about is if I do catch covid what will it do to my nose? Like I've already got something eating holes in my nose. And for the anti maskers no it's not because of wearing masks. I have wore masks in my woodshop for hours at a time, for many years and never had a problem with them. 

Does any of this sound like issues any of you have had with your eyes and or nose. I don't think it's a sinus infection and since when would a sinus infection eat holes in the nose!?",2022-04-18 9:56

"Insurance companies and schools and bureaucracies shouldn't be making things like this difficult. If there are alterations that need to be made for medical reasons as dictated by a licensed physician, what business does anyone else have trying to stand in a doctor or families way of doing what's right for the child in these scenarios?   In the case of the TDap, I couldn't have the combo but I got the tetanus and diphtheria shots separately (which the insurance also made a stink about because why pay for 2 shots when there's a one shot combo?) but something about specifically the pertussis component of the TDap was the problem so when it came to pertussis, I was one of the kids who needed my classmates and teachers to be vaccinated for it if they could be since I could not.   The school however, threw a fit over it. It was back and forth between my pediatrician, the school nurse, and the principal for about a month every summer trying to make these people understand that for me at least, the risks outweighed the benefits (pretty sure they thought he was an anti-vax quack, which considering he was the one also fighting to get insurance to cover the two separate shots and the pneumonia vaccine is laughable)   And in the case of pneumonia, at the time (apparently this is now changed which is good to hear) but back then, it wasn't standard for children so since I was the vulnerable one the decision was made to give me the vaccine. Side note, 3 years ago when I went to the pharmacy to get the flu shot, COVID vaccine, and prevnar 21, I had to argue with the pharmacist about the prevnar for an hour. ""You're in your 20s, you don't need that"" Well, here's my full immunization record showing I have had the childhood version, here's some of the paperwork from the hospital the 3 times I had the illness itself, and here's proof of the birth defects that put me in the high risk group for complications. ""None of this proves anything"" the hell it does.   The problem isn't that there's a general guide line, the problem is that so many people in the different facets of this are so wed to it that when there's an outlier that outlier and their medical team and support system have to fight like hell to get them what they need and protect them from what could hurt them because they take the baseline recommendations that apply to most as gospel for everyone.

"Hello, I would like some advice.

I received 5 doses of rabies vaccine in 2023, and then I received 2 booster doses on May 2, 2024.

Yesterday, I had a Category 2 exposure (not a deep bite, possibly a light scratch through my pants). Now it has been about 3 to 4 days since exposure.

I went to a local clinic in Myanmar, and the doctor there told me I need to restart the full 5-dose vaccine series again, even after I explained my full vaccine history.

But I have read that:

WHO and CDC say people who already had a full series do not need to restart the full series after exposure.

Only 2 booster doses (Day 0 and Day 3) are needed after re-exposure — even years later.

My booster on May 2, 2024 is still very recent (just 1year and 2 months ago), so I should already be protected.


I’m very poor and rabies vaccines are expensive in Myanmar. I want to understand:

1. Is the full vaccine series really needed again in my case?


2. How long does a rabies booster protect someone?


3. Is it too late to get vaccinated now (Day 3-4)?


4. Am I still protected from my May booster?



Thank you. I have already read the WHO FAQ and I’m trying to do the right thing.

"Got my COVID booster yesterday (Thursday) after work. The arm pain didn't start at all for like 4-5 hours, which I thought was weird and slow. Middle of the night and next morning arm pain is pretty bad. I haven't really noticed other symptoms - usually I get pretty bad headaches. My dreams were vivid?

Anyway, I left the bandaid on and notice that it's really high on my arm. Not in the beefiest part of my muscle. Only about one finger below the acromion.

How worried about it's effectiveness would you be if you were me? 

I would prefer answers supported by evidence. I found standard nursing vacation IM administration guidelines, and those recommend at least two fingers below the acromion and above the armpit.

Update:
He knew exactly where it was: it was bleeding. I took the bandaid off this morning and there's a small bruise at the site.

Glad to hear effectiveness shouldn't be an issue. I was worried since my overall immune reaction seemed less than other COVID shots I've gotten.

Fortunately, he missed the shoulder capsule - I think/hope - though he got pretty damn close.

Shoulder pain is basically non-existent. I went climbing yesterday with it and nothing bad happened.

So, end result: it was fine. He DID go high. That may have made it more painful than normal.
The vaccine-arm pain wasn't my concern: my concern was that it took so long to start and the lack of other symptoms. And it being objectively not where it was supposed to be.

Then the second day, ""Well its a big deal, but will magically disappear"".  Then, ""It's just like a moderately bad case of the flu...nothing to worry about"".   Then, ""I wash my hands of this, up to the governors"".  Then ""Why aren't you opening?!"".  Then ""Liberate your state!"".  Then ""I don't think masks really work, but if you want to wear one.""

I saw recently two cashiers wearing their masks this way and yesterday I was visiting a zoo and there was a mask wearing obligation for the queue at the entrance and again two women were there wearing their masks wrong. It is just so stupid. Why not wear the mask properly? Especially the people in the queue at the zoo only had to wear it for about 5 minutes.

"Quite frankly, as an American, I'm quite sad at how the USA has handled this situation in all respects. In situations like this I guess I was naively thinking/hoping that everyone could put aside their differences and collectively do what it takes to contain this thing.  Especially from a leadership point of view. Yes there are many citizens that didn't believe the reality of the situation and only acted in a selfish way. But it starts with strong leadership at the top all the way down.  I was shocked by the decisions made by POTUS and many state governors as well as local authorities, acting like this whole thing was a hoax, or downplaying it as much as they were.  Respect of your government is what keeps people in solidarity and acting collectively to do what it takes for the betterment of the nation. Clearly we don't have any respect, and for good reason. Those that claim oppression by being asked to wear masks is annoying and a clear indication of people that don't have an understanding of what our freedoms mean.

"# **Abstract**  > *Myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), long COVID (LC) and post-COVID-19 vaccine syndrome show similarities in their pathophysiology and clinical manifestations. These disorders are related to viral or adjuvant persistence, immunological alterations, autoimmune diseases and hormonal imbalances.*   > *A developmental model is postulated that involves the interaction between immune hyperactivation, autoimmune hypophysitis or pituitary hypophysitis, and immune depletion. This process might begin with a deficient CD4 T-cell response to viral infections in genetically predisposed individuals (HLA-DRB1), followed by an uncontrolled immune response with CD8 T-cell hyperactivation and elevated antibody production, some of which may be directed against autoantigens, which can trigger autoimmune hypophysitis or direct damage to the pituitary, resulting in decreased production of pituitary hormones, such as ACTH.*   > *As the disease progresses, prolonged exposure to viral antigens can lead to exhaustion of the immune system, exacerbating symptoms and pathology. It is suggested that these disorders could be included in the autoimmune/adjuvant-induced inflammatory syndrome (ASIA) because of their similar clinical manifestations and possible relationship to genetic factors, such as polymorphisms in the HLA-DRB1 gene. In addition, it is proposed that treatment with antivirals, corticosteroids/ginseng, antioxidants, and metabolic precursors could improve symptoms by modulating the immune response, pituitary function, inflammation and oxidative stress.*   > ***Therefore, the purpose of this review is to suggest a possible autoimmune origin against the adenohypophysis and a possible improvement of symptoms after treatment with corticosteroid replacement therapy.***  # **Keywords**  *myalgic encephalomyelitis, long COVID, post-COVID-19 vaccine syndrome, ASIA syndrome, EBV, SARS-CoV-2, HLA-II, hypophysitis*",2024-08-23 16:18

"The response to this virus tells you *so much* about the culture of a nation.

It's just that it's a little more controlled -- which can mean the difference between life and death for a lot of folks.  I don't think the US is a culture that can be locked down, at all. I doubt democrats would have done much better. There is just too fierce a streak of the individualist, my-freedom-at-all-costs sort of mindset.

I asked the physician if the nurse could draw the vaccine in the office so I could confirm that the correct vaccine was given, along with checking the expiration date. The physician took it personally and told me that if I didn’t trust the office, then I should not be their patient. The nurse, on the other hand, didn’t have any problems with this request and showed me the vial. The reason I initially asked the doctor and not the nurse was because I would not see the nurse until she was ready to administer shots. 

I am an RN, but I left nursing a while ago. I was working on the ICU floor, but I would occasionally float to pediatrics, and there were times when parents requested that I show them what medications were administered or verify insulin dosage. I never had an issue with them and always complied with the request, understanding that there is a human factor and that errors, unfortunately, happen to the best of us.

I have bad anxiety when it comes to vaccines and their potential side effects (tinnitus, neurological problems, etc.) I've concluded that the ones that should be considered are vaccines for rabies, hep B, and Japanese Encephalitis. I understand that the potential benefits outweigh any potential side effects that these shots may come with, but I'm still reluctant to get them due to my fear of the ""what if"".

"Does anyone have any insight on the risk of receiving the JYNNEOS smallpox/monkeypox vaccine close to the mRNA COVID vaccines?

Where I live (Washington DC) I am eligible for the JYNNEOS shot and I got my first dose of the vaccine yesterday. I was reading the VIS sheet last night, and it indicates that adolescent/young adult males should consider to wait 4 weeks before getting an mRNA vaccine due to the risk of myocarditis. I did some quick research into it, and it seems that the warning is simply because there is a documented risk of myocarditis between the mRNA vaccines and ACAM2000 (a different type of smallpox vaccine administered with a bifurcated needle) and the risk with JYNNEOS is currently unknown.

I didn't realize that the JYNNEOS was a two-part vaccine, and my second shot is scheduled for 17 August. If the CDC were to theoretically authorize a second booster for those <50 years soon, would there be an official guidance to wait until say early October to mitigate risk? I'm 27 and was vaccinated + boosted with Moderna if it matters, and most data shows that the risk is highest in 16-24 y/o males.",2022-07-22 0:47

"I am not sure how old you are, but I am late 20s- (Female), no children yet, had covid a month ago. My personal biggest concern (and only impacting those of child bearing age groups) is that there are no significant and long term studies which promise there to be no impact on fertility (in both Male/ Female), instead I see concerning data regarding the spike proteins in the vaccines gathering in ovaries and testes. Whether these specific claims are true or not (I am no scientist), the severe censorship of any opposing science to the mainstream ideology of the vaccine programme raise huge red flags for me. And the absolute fact of the matter is, these vaccines are still in experimental stages. In addition, the fact that no one is exploring treatment rather than pushing ineffective (non sterilising, as can be seen in recent data from uk and Israel) vaccines are another concern- if the agenda was to save lives, this should surely be the first route. Additionally the complete disregard for previous infection which many scientific journals have proved incite immunity (apparently stronger than the vaccine/ immunity to all variants). Your decision is entirely your own, and I respect anyone’s wish to either take the vax or not, although it seems my body is no longer my own to govern. I guess my biggest advice to you would be to consider how historically censorship has been used to control behaviour and drive an agenda. I would be much more inclined to take this Vaccine if there had been an open and honest conversation allowed, rather than the unvacced becoming shunned with increasingly diminished freedoms.

"Hi, I hope this is an appropriate place to ask a question regarding the rabies vaccine.
I am travelling from Europe to Indonesia next month and thought I'd be an adult for once and get the appropriate vaccines.
My new gp went through the list with me and we settled on, among others, the rabies vaccine (Rabipur).


While waiting for them to be ready to give me the shot, I read up on the vaccine out of boredom, and was surprised to find that the prep recommendation is a 3 shot regimen with a dose on day 0, day 7 and day 21/28 (and additional shots after you are actually exposed, i.e. bitten by an animal). Some sources claim this was updated in 2018 to be 2 shots only, but every site I read speaks definitively of multiple shots. I don't recall ever having had any as a child, but would definitely need the full set either way.


I had a prescription for only 1 shot, the doctor's assistant was not clear on the advice, and when I asked the gp herself, she waved me off and said ""we only ever administer one shot for this, it's completely normal.""


Can I trust this advice, or should I seek another medical opinion? I am uneasy, since the Internet very strongly disagrees with this take. Would appreciate any input, given the next shot would have to be next week (and I would need to find a new physician in the very short term to get it done on time).

"The FDA and the CDC are separate entities even though they both fall under the umbrella of the Department of Health and Human Services. While both are supposed to protect and promote community health, they do it in different ways. The FDA regulates the quality of our food and medicine, determining what is safe to give to people in general. The CDC issues recommendations to doctors and insurers about what the best practices are when administering the FDA-approved medicines, procedures, etc. So in this case, the FDA is saying the Moderna Covid vaccine is approved for use in children, but the CDC is saying that doctors still shouldn’t give it to children (giving insurance an excuse not to cover the vaccine) unless it is a case of “high risk”.   The CDC recommendations really don’t make sense, but there is a strong political tinge there. There’s a long issue of having to make CDC recommendations palatable to the administration in charge. Don’t get me started on the whole issue regarding things like masturbation, condoms, etc. all of which hit political live wires and made the CDC give recommendations that didn’t quite match what the science was saying.",2025-07-10 14:07

When asked to help make more he said ""why? no need"", then he later said he would help, then he bought extra from a stockpile.

Musk had seem to be planning to wait until it's too late and people are dying in droves before he actually makes some ventilators.  These ventilators he is giving away were just a means to appease the people begging him to help make new ones. Instead of taking the request seriously he bought some to give away, but what we need from him is producing new ones, not reshuffling a warehouse stock of existing ones.

Now, I do get the novavax- I feel better w an older technology bc I do think mRNA hasn’t been around long enough for studies.

"Hi everyone,

I could really use some advice.

I (23F) got my **first dose of Gardasil 9 on May 15**. I was planning to get my **second dose on July 15** and the **third dose on November 15**, but honestly, I’m not sure if I can afford all 3 doses right now since in my country we have to pay for the HPV vaccine ourselves.

I’ve seen different recommendations from health authorities about 1, 2, or 3-dose schedules, and it’s confusing. I’ve read that WHO and some studies say a single dose can be effective, while other guidelines still recommend 3 doses, especially for older age groups.

Given that I’m 23 and started the vaccine at this age:

* Is **1 dose enough** for me?
* Would **2 doses be protective**, or is it not sufficient at my age?
* Do I really need all **3 doses** to get proper protection?

I really want to protect myself against HPV, but the financial side is tough. Any insights from people who’ve been in a similar situation, or any healthcare professionals here, would be so appreciated.

Thank you!",2025-07-10 21:34
"I don't WANT to get into some heated debate with you about this but I'd like to give you a little insight on those of us who have ""little Reddit history""...in my particular case, and I'm sure many others, we go looking for answers when something is bothering us.

In my experience, ESPECIALLY with anything to do with this vaccine, when I google questions or concerns I have about, or I'm looking for those who have had a similar experience, I'm often LED to sub-Reddit posts about the vaccine. I begin reading the posts and maybe I find one I want to respond to, so some of us need to create an account or activate an existing one we seldom use because we don't visit Reddit often but have used it sporadically.

""It is therefore important to take into consideration that such non-specific effects, and their immunological basis, have been established for several other vaccines.2,21 Non-specific effects of vaccines have been observed to differ between live-attenuated vaccines and non-live vaccines; live vaccines have been associated with reduced all-cause mortality while this has not been seen for non-live vaccines.2 For example, RCTs have shown that Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis reduces neonatal mortality by more than a third,22,23 due to protection against deaths from sepsis and respiratory infections. In parallel, immunological studies have provided a mechanism by showing that BCG induces “trained immunity” leading to enhanced resistance toward a broad range of pathogens.""",2023-05-10 6:45

"Then you're letting this virus control your life and that's just as dumb as not using a mask, washing your hands etc. Let's be perfectly clear here, there is a risk of death with Covid, but that risk is very small. First there is a very small risk that it actually spreads, and then there is a very small risk that anyone will actually die. The reason we hear about these things is because they're rare and therefore news worthy.   In Sweden, the death rate for people aged 0-69 with a confirmed covid-19 infection is 0.1%. In reality that will be even lower since there will be plenty of recoveries in people that were never tested. Then if you're in the 0-40 age range it's going to be even lower than that. Then you need to multiply that by the risk of getting infected, which quite frankly isn't very big at all since the people you're meeting probably don't have covid.

I'm not trying to hold him to some standard where it would be impossible to get credit for anything and in my prior post I highlighted some areas where I believe he could have demonstrated a serious commitment through his own personal actions and words.

"> It's almost certain he might not have contracted it at all and if he did it would have been mild.  No. Masks are like seatbelts. They help, a lot, but wearing a seatbelt is not a guarantee you won't be seriously injured or killed in an accident.  And you can't just do whatever you want while wearing a seatbelt either-- going to a massive rally is somewhat akin to going 140mph down a highway. Whether you're wearing your seatbelt is not really the top issue, the top issue is that you shouldn't be driving so recklessly in the first place.",2020-07-30 15:39

"That’s so scary :(   It just seems odd to me that everyone that’s been denied a test has been given different excuses or criteria they have to meet. I would think everyone would be on the same page regarding what qualifies someone to be tested. It makes sense that knowing who is sick would help with containment because the health authority could see who the sick person had been in contact with and then test those people or tell them to self quarantine. If people don’t know they’re sick or have come into direct contact with an infected person then they could still be going out to public places and exposing countless others. I don’t know, at the end of the day I’m not educated about these types of things so what do I know. It just seems counterproductive to limiting how quickly the virus is spread.   I am really sorry about your mom though. I just had a baby early and they sent us home after just a week in the hospital so I understand your fear. Bringing a premie home during all of this is the last thing I wanted to do. Did your sister tell the doctor about your mom? I guess they would tell her to self quarantine regardless of the test results but it would still be nice to have that peace of mind, especially because we don’t know how long we are contagious before becoming symptomatic. Can your mom try and get tested since she does have a pre-existing condition? She would probably be told that since she hasn’t had direct contact with an infected person that she doesn’t need to be tested. It’s just a nightmare.

"To preface, I worked as an RN in the ICU during COVID and was begging everyone I knew to get vaccinated. I interacted with many unvaccinated patients who died from COVID, and very willingly got all three vaccinations, all from Pfizer. I am not blowing any whistles, just seeking info from all angles to figure out what’s been going on with me.

Since 10/2021, the month I received my third booster, I have had abnormal and intensely painful periods. These begin with spotting, then a few days of nothing, and then 7-8 days of full and particularly heavy flow, with a total of around 11 days of bleeding. During the first two days of full flow, I have debilitating low abdominal, low back, hip, thigh, and knee pain. I feel feverish and cannot get warm, I am very fatigued, and have intense brain fog. During this time, I cannot do anything but lay down. Ibuprofen will help with pain, but it usually takes 2-3 hours to have an effect, and then I must take it every 3.5 hours.

I took meloxicam (anti-inflammatory used typically for arthritis or other joint pain) for a short stint in 2023, during which I had normal periods with virtually no pain.

In January of 2024, I started taking supplements to boost progesterone, as most of the issues I am dealing with these days could be linked to an abundance of estrogen. I now have slightly shorter cycles, a little less pain, less fatigue and brain fog, less bleeding, and no feverishness.

A few other things that happened prior to my cycle changes could have increased my estrogen levels, and I’ve also since discovered I have a gene mutation that affects my ability to process estrogen and B vitamins. In the spring of 2021 I took estrogen based birth control for the first time. I also used plan B, an estrogen based medication, in August 2021.

It seems like a perfect storm that led me to have an imbalance of estrogen and progesterone. I don’t know if the vaccine had anything to do with this, but I am aware that it affected a large number of women’s cycles immediately after vaccination, but these changes were not recorded as being long term. I’m interested to hear from anyone who knows about the mechanism of action that led to these brief cycle changes for other women.

Of note, I have been dealing with chronic pain and inflammation since summer 2023. Also, I only had Covid once in June 2022.

Has anybody else experienced similar changes around the time of vaccination that have not gone away? I’m just trying to get to the bottom of what happened and what continues to go on in my body, and our US healthcare system is often woefully incapable of helping women with issues related to menstruation.

"Why wouldn't letting the healthy get it stop the spread? In absolute numbers, the cases will go up, sure.  But the real fear is the vulnerable.

Regardless, even if that were not true, locking down a population has huge economic and personal costs. If the only objective is stopping COVID, then sure, ignore those costs and lockdown.  Because we don't live in a world where we can ignore that, we have to consider where we are taking from the economy to help the public health. I think that letting people balance the risks themselves is the best way to find that out.  I view it very similar to driving in a snow storm.

"At my last job at a for profit urgent care chain, I was doing this already.  I would fill out workmans comp paperwork for any patient who was an essential healthcare worker with confirmed contact with COVID+ patients who developed COVID themselves.  Our employer services department was ripshit because it meant the workmans comp insurance would have to pay for the inpatient hospitalization for transfers and have to report that their EMTs who weren't issued N95s were all coming down with work related COVID.  The average person doesn't realize how much downward pressure there is to look the other way or walk on eggshells to prevent injuries from becoming reportable work related injuries.  For example, would get pressured to just steri strip lacerations deep to the subcutaneous fat because sutures makes it an OSHA reportable injury.  We would get told to not debride burns so they wouldn't be OSHA reportable injuries.  Splints with metal braces in them require OSHA reporting but soft over-the-counter  wrist braces that you can get from Walgreens for $6 dont so my last employer removed all the effective  braces to pressure us into giving the shitty soft braces with no support to side step the OSHA reporting requirements.  I would just write them a prescription to get the brace from a medical supplies pharmacy.    Its crazy to me that you getting poison ivy on the job is considered work related and receives no pushback, but you working around COVID+ patients and developing COVID isn't and gets a tremendous amount of pushback.  There was a tremendous amount of pressure for us to just conclude ""well who is to say where the healthcare worker working 70 hrs a week providing direct patient care to confirmed COVID+ patients contracted COVID from.""  Its one the reasons I certainly don't miss for profit urgent care.  I used to get told that our job was to keep the employers who sent their workers to us happy.  No it isn't.

"Hi All,

First time poster, but a comment thread recently was super kind and helpful, so, here I am.

Because of certain scheduling things and upcoming travel I'm thinking about getting the flu shot early (as in today or tomorrow), and I'm wondering a couple of things. Tomorrow at 10 AM I have a dental cleaning (I have to get them every four months), not as bad as root planing but even maintenance ones can be intense and they sometimes I think use a kind of Ozone spray, if that affects anything.

Anyway, given the exposure to actual illnesses risks of going to the dentist, and that vaccines can make one feel run down, here are my questions:

1. Would getting the shot this afternoon be a terrible idea (sometime within the next five hours), given having to teach tonight and tomorrow morning's appointment? Not sure I can even schedule this.

2. Would getting the shot tomorrow early afternoon, after the dental cleaning, work better? I'm not sure immune system wise in what order to pile on, i.e. shot night before and cleaning after, or, shot hours after cleaning.

3. I'd rather not wait until Wednesday for the vaccine, but, would that be the actual best option?

4. Given everything *gestures broadly* this year's shot is still considered okay? I'm being repetitive, I've seen this question already asked on this forum, but I'm uneasy about whatever changes that may be being made that have nothing to do with health or science. I've seen comments to the effect of that next year's vaccines will be what's affected as opposed to this year's.

Thank you so much for reading and for any guidance ❤️",2025-08-19 4:09

Hospitals are now turning people away sometimes because their symptoms don't warrant concern. They're having to do this because so many people are concerned about this coronavirus. Someone has a runny nose, and he/she thinks it's covid-19 when it's only allergies. I'll agree to disagree with you. I don't think this approach was appropriate or necessary.

"Ok I get what your referring to, but the massive increases in reproductive organs, larger intestines and Bone Marrow, are not explored further outside of the testing on the Rats and test tube testing.   Although a human liver is tested on, there is no drop off indicated with the higher dosage.    I might be missing something, that is obvious to you and I apologise if thats the case.    Currently I am trying to understand, a pattern, why CBD oil with 0.01mg THC per 10mg CBD oil appears to treat covid.  By trying to understand when a blood clot isn’t a blood clot.  Which I think I can explain by looking at the quirky aspects of the Covid infection, in how the Virus initially affects the blood in the body, and infecting the blood producers, in this case the Bone marrow, causing the blood to appear thick.   But whats causing the lowering of B12 levels in the body and other characteristics of the infection.   So I drew up a long list of the known effects in the body from covid and isolated about a dozen areas that could be affected solely by assuming the “trust the science” arguments that its just blood clotting is true.    But that doesn’t explain away all the possible causes, as 20 days before my infection, I was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism (Blood clot), and whilst the result is similar, causing blood clotting effects, including the Acute Respiratory distress / Inflammatory storms in my lungs restricting my breathing.    Plus turning my blood into a thicker blood, indicating a serious complication, other things did not make any sense.  Sure because I am not in the medical field, but also after trying to understand the problem better, with my knew knowledge from seeing the effects of CBD on my own infection.    A blood clot whilst being a convenient explanation, doesn’t fit, the evidence and symptoms being caused.    However whilst its something I had never heard of happening in the vast amount of books journals and papers I read, I knew that gelling agents existed and had seen the way jelly behaves in certain tempratures, close to that of body temperature.   So I explored that theory further, as because of all the other explanations I could find, all the others only explained away a few things.  But the jellying of the blood, explained away all besides the reproductive organs, where I myself experienced erectile dysfunction and infertility issues.    But as I experimented with a ever increasing dose of CBD, the erectile dysfunction reduced and whilst difficult it improved in function, but seaman production seems not to be happening.    So whilst my best guess was that the CBD oil could be binding to the ACE 2 blocking the spike receptors function, I cant prove this, but looking at the evidence I found, trying again to find another explanation, all roads seemed to return back to the CBD being an effective treatment.    My worry currently from reading the FOI document, is firstly that the vaccine, leaves the arm, within 6 days, and infects the body, in a way that the public information, states is impossible that it would drift, but in this FOI document, its obvious that it has drifted.  With the claim without additional information supporting the claim absent from the report.    I may be an amateur climate scientist, and not in the medical community, but I am seeing a lot of answers being given without a y working out, with no explanation to support the papers and like even this report infers its fully safe, disappearing after 6 days from the point of insertion after 6 / 9 days, but where is the detailed breakdown for the concentrations in the body?",2021-06-27 20:38

It instructs your cells to manufacture spike and your immune system teaches itself to destroy the spike that the vaccine has instructed your cells to produce. This process isn’t gone in a matter of hours. There is no known time it takes for the body to stop making spike. The Yale study called ‘Immunological and Antigenic Signatures Associated with Chronic Illnesses after COVID-19 Vaccination’ found a participant still producing spike 709 days after last vaccination. The spike protein is toxic and it’s been found all over the bodies of vaccinated individuals including brain, ovaries, testes, liver, heart etc. The spike protein has been found in tumors of cancer patients. The mRNA used is coated in lipid nano particles which are themselves potentially toxic and inflammatory and this coating prevents the mRNA from breaking down rapidly as natural mRNA would. It doesn’t “stay in your arm” and break down rapidly as was originally claimed. Empirical evidence such as the findings of Yale study prove what I’m saying is true.",2025-07-26 22:49

China did it when they needed more supplies, they raided a lot of countries for supplies in january and february.

The body develops antibodies once the virus enters the body. What is going on right now?! Why all this panic now when we didn't see it in years past for viruses with higher death rates that were just as contagious?   This virus passes like other coronaviruses...through saliva. So, if you're worried, stay a few feet away from someone who's sneezing or coughing, and wash your hand frequently. Avoid touching your face. If you're really worried, spray some lysol on the objects of yours that have passed hands. If you get sick, then take tylenol to control the fever and drink plenty of fluids.

"Hey everyone, I (F24) was raised by anti-vax parents. They were well-intentioned and while I strongly disagree with them, I know they were doing what they thought was right. However, I also know that the misinformation they were crediting as “medical research” was obviously incredibly misled and am somewhat concerned about my health as an adult. 

Am I able to receive all the vaccines I never got as a child as an adult? Are there certain vaccines I should prioritize? I did get both COVID shots plus the booster as well as one flu shot, but so far that is all I have ever received. 

I am extremely worried about my vulnerability to diseases. I am healthy, no chronic health issues besides mild asthma and some gastrointestinal sensitivities. However, I have gotten some extreme sicknesses in the last decade or so (rare, but they have happened) that probably would have only been a bad flu if not for my body being at a low defense level due to a lack of vaccines. For example, I got a flu when I was 17 that resulted in multiple days of dangerously high fever, extreme dehydration, convulsions, etc. Again, this has only happened about three times in 10 years, but I am acutely aware that that is not even remotely normal in the modern age for a regular flu in a healthy young body. I am not a doctor and have no idea how any of this works, but the concern is there.

Doctors are the quarterbacks, nurse aides are running backs, nurses are wide receivers, respiratory therapists are your tight ends, and everyone else make up the line. It does not function without every piece.   This problem about forgetting people who work in healthcare is not unique to the public. Nurses are some of the worst offenders (though everyone forgets done). They put themselves up on a pedestal while depending on every ancillary department and don't help to incorporate the rest of the disciplines into their group. Nurses get to negotiate for themselves for better pay while lab, respiratory, radiology etc get passed on.   When your loved one comes in with respiratory distress the order it in which people get seen by each specific discipline is as follows (obviously not like this every single time especially depending on severity): paramedics and EMTs pick up the patient in the home to come to the hospital. Nurse, aid, and respiratory therapist waiting for patient to arrive for immediate care and transition from EMT and paramedic. lab and radiology soon to follow so that we can have some information on how to treat the patient. Doctor in to manage case and perform invasive procedures if required.   admissions is in there to start getting paperwork and start the process of contacting family if no one is known. Depending on the case social work and chaplains may currently be involved. Now that the patient's stable and we moved from ER to inpatient.

"Sixth monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine elicits robust immune response against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in heart transplant recipients ___    Abstract - (March 22, 2024)   Continued circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has driven the selection of variants with improved ability to escape pre-existing vaccine-induced responses, posing a persistent threat to heart transplant recipients (HTRs). The immunogenicity and safety of the updated XBB.1.5-containing monovalent vaccines are unknown. We prospectively enrolled 52 HTRs who had previously received a 5-dose ancestral-derived monovalent and bivalent mRNA vaccination schedule to receive the monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine. Immunogenicity was evaluated using live virus micro-neutralization assays. The XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine elicited potent and diverse neutralizing responses and broadened the reactivity spectrum to encompass newer strains, with the highest increase in neutralization activity being more pronounced against XBB.1.5 (15.8-fold) and JN.1 (13.3-fold) than against BA.5 (6.7-fold) and WT (4-fold). Notably, XBB.1.5 and JN.1 were resistant to neutralization by pre-vaccination sera. There were no safety concerns. Our findings support updating of COVID-19 vaccines to match antigenically divergent variants and exclude ancestral spike-antigen to protect HTRs.",2024-03-31 17:14

"NO!  From the CDC website :   Who Should NOT Get Vaccinated If you have had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or an immediate allergic reaction, even if it was not severe, to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (such as polyethylene glycol), you should not get either of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. If you had a severe or immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get a second dose of either of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. A severe allergic reaction is one that needs to be treated with epinephrine or EpiPen or with medical care. Learn about common side effects of COVID-19 vaccines and when to call a doctor. An immediate allergic reaction means a reaction within 4 hours of exposure, including symptoms such as hives, swelling, or wheezing (respiratory distress). If you aren’t able to get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you may still be able to get a different type of COVID-19 vaccine. Get more information for people with allergies.",2021-08-11 21:07

Herd immunity also takes into account the effectiveness of the vaccine.  So if the effectiveness is 95% sure herd immunity could be 70%. Now the delta variant lowers that effectiveness so herd immunity has to compensate by going up.   It's not moving goal posts its a mutation in the virus.

I think I've been very careful in not trying to put words in his mouth but instead commenting on the hypothetical people seem to be arguing which has become 'it's okay to lie to protect the supply' which is contextually supported by phrases like ""ethically grey"" (there's nothing ethically grey about saying something that doesn't work doesn't work) and ""game theoretical"" which is justifying lying in order to enable the supply line. I made sure to specifically state:  >not sure if Fauci actually said this but people are defending this line as if he actually said it when it's ethically untenable under modern medicine's standards.  This line being that masks are useless for the public in order to curb coronavirus. Obviously if he didn't actually say it, he's not at fault. My concern is more the people supporting that logic rather than with Fauci specifically which is why I included a caveat on both of my first responses to various threads in this post.  The point is that medical professionals have an obligation to provide accurate and precise information and that people defending this whole ""game theory"" side is pure nonsense. Turning public health into a game of chess is inadvisable and would have incredibly negative long term consequences - this is the exact logic being protected and words that Fauci may not have said are being used as a proxy for this issue.",2020-04-02 23:52

"I am telling you, you will be fine financially and if you went into medicine for the right reasons, and it seems that you did, you will find fulfillment.  I spent past ten years guiding med students through their residencies and early careers, and so far have not found one that was disappointed with their choices.  You do have to be a bit smart about contracting from the get go (know the wRVU production norms in your region before you walk into that interview, etc.), and be ready to work hard long hours early on (moonlighting, etc.), but in the end your debt will be manageable.  I am sure you understand the trade offs.  In the Netherlands and other advanced health systems, education is free, but the doctors cap out at moderate incomes, comparable with the rest of society's professional class.  In America, you incur seemingly great debt, but you make it up with far greater lifetime income potential.  And it is that potential, spread over decades of your professional life, for which you pay.  In short, it is an investment, something I am sure you understood when you signed up for it.  There are caveats.  Medical schools charging full price for the fourth year is daylight robbery as the students spend their times on away rotations and their school does nothing outside of writing the deans letter.  They will tell you that they are merely spreading the cost evenly over the four years, but I do agree with you that current prices went overboard.  Schools charging the third years this year is even worse, for this is where the clinicals should be happening and no amount of online instruction can sub for that.  But all I want to do here, and I don't usually spend any time on reddit, is to inject a little hope into your, and your fellow med students, perception of things.  There are lofty popularized ideas and then there is a cold hard fact that my team and I have spent 49 consecutive grueling days fighting for each and every life in that ICU of ours.  What do we have to show for these efforts? Dozens of patients lost and two saved.  Tens of nurses, doctors, respiratory techs working full time in our tight masks and getting exposed to the deadliest COVID cases you can find, and all we got is two patients.  But those two, oh were they worth it.  We dont watch TV, listen to the rhetoric...just get up each morning and work...and trust me once you do that, you look around your team and recognize...this took courage.  Real courage that has nothing to do with the bs you hear on TV, as you say.  So, as I sat here in my home isolation room on that first day off after 7 weeks of non stop stress, I had nothing to do and found this thread.  And I am here to tell you again, you will be privileged to do incredible work in your life and please do not stress about the debt.  Work hard, be smart with your money and things will be ok.

"I got my Pfizer second shot early in the day Saturday. I was feeling fine throughout the day with no side effects. Because I thought I was good, I went out for some drinks. At around 10:00 that night, things took a turn for the worst. 

I got the chills, which worried my friends as the place was objectively hot. I went home, now having chills, sweats, fever, headache, nausea, and shortness of breath. I vomited and then tried to get to sleep without much success. 

Eventually it became morning and I had a big headache, fever, chills/sweats, and shortness of breath. I assumed these were normal symptoms, so I just tried to rest. I would have spasms of shortness of breath, where it would hurt to breath and I would hyperventilate, making my heart race. These would last about an hour and a half. I will call these “attacks” from here on out. Outside of that, all normal. 

Monday I woke up with chest pain. Most of the other symptoms were either gone or way down, but my upper body was sore. I assumed this was just residual discomfort and moved on. It was a pretty good day. 

Monday night I woke up middle of the night drenched in my own sweat, freezing, headache, struggling to breathe. This would be the first of a few “attacks” to come my way - I got back to sleep, then it happened again in the morning. Due for the fact that my side effects worsened from Monday to Tuesday, I went to the ER. 

In the ER, they performed a couple of tests. My ekg was normal, blood pressure was normal, etc. and most things were good. One thing that stood out to the doctors though was elevated levels of troponin. For those who do not know, this protein is found primarily in the muscles of the heart. It should have a reading of 0.0, as it is should not be in your blood. My reading was over 8 (unsure of units), which was high. They admitted me and diagnosed me with myocarditis. 

My level dropped throughout the day as low as 5ish, but I had another attack prior to going to sleep. This attack came with a higher level of chest pain than usual, so they gave me morphine and I eventually stabilized. They rechecked my levels and I was at 9. These attacks - likely caused by the inflamed heart - would put additional pressure on my heart , and make it worse. This is the problem with this condition - sometimes it just gets better over time, other times things degrade. Luckily for me, I have not had an attack since Tuesday and am set to be discharged today (Thursday) as my levels are back down. An echocardiogram (sonogram of heart) revealed no structural damage, and upon discharge I am set to rest and try to to get my heart rate up. 

(Note: I have no underlying medical conditions)

Edit: the units used for the protein in this post and all comments are ng/mL.",2021-05-27 21:49

"I think this blame game is extremely risky.  When someone gets covid it is not necessarily their ""fault"" - meaning they could have been following every single guideline perfectly and because their apple was touched by an essential worker who was asymptomatic with covid and actively shedding virus, they got it.  So he may have been isolating (I have no idea).  The problem is there is no way to be 100% isolated.  Even if you don't leave your house or see your friends, you have to eat and food is delivered - mail is delivered there are small interactions or touching of objects.  Furthermore, he's 87.  He definitely had at least one doctors appointment over the last year - that is considered essential but not necessarily risk free.  Masks limit spread but don't eliminate it completely.  The problem is EVERYONE needs be isolating and wearing masks and washing hands etc.    So if you would isolate to the moon and back if you were 87 - you should isolate to the moon and back at whatever your age currently is.  That is the WHOLE thing with covid - we should all be doing that to protect the 87 year olds.  I am much younger than 87.  If I get covid I will (statistically speaking) be fine.  I could realistically live my life without following any of the covid protocols and be fine.  But I understand that this is my contribution to society - not being an asshole, wearing a mask on my face, using zoom to keep in touch with friends, drinking at home instead of at a bar.

"Maybe take that out on the people who refused to get vaccinated when THEY WORK IN MEDICAL. The people who traditionally require the most medical care are the ones who are really the incubators for the variants. Immunocompromised people. Like me. A virus passing from one vaccinated person to another vaccinated person doesn’t have a whole lot of time, and therefore chance, to mutate. It’s when it hits someone like myself. I’ve had two Moderna shots and I’ll get the booster as soon as it is available in my area again. The amount of antibodies I’ve gained from those two shots is very small. So let’s say I get smacked in the face with Delta. Much higher odds that I’m going to be seriously ill and as close to certain as can be that I’ll be significantly more ill than a normal person. So it gets to sit in me, having a nice little vacation, looking at the sights and taking its time. And mutating.   It’s as close to proven as it really can be that the Alpha and Delta variants were born in that exact way; an immunocompromised person who spent weeks to months dealing with the virus. A virus never stops evolving, but it needs TIME to do that. If you’ve gotten vaccinated, you’re denying that virus much needed time to learn and mutate. Just like how you’re not sick for an extended time in the hospital. Maybe you get a breakthrough infection, but you’re not giving the virus the chance to learn what it needs to know from you to become bigger and badder.  I can hear the cries of “well then you stay home!” But you see, that’s just ignorance and selfishness. I take Humira. And Humira is the highest selling drug in the world. The people yearling that don’t care to know that I’m not a cancer patient. I haven’t had an organ transplant. I’m a 38 woman who owns a business and you’d never know by looking at me that my immune system is almost nonexistent.   But I’m the patient you see much more frequently than others. Just normally. Without a pandemic going on.  Fact: the vaccine makes it less likely you will catch COVID. It also DOES reduce the spread and ANY reduction is STILL REDUCTION.   Those medical “professionals” who refused to get a vaccine SHOULD be fired. They are either ignorant of their own field or uncaring assholes when it comes to their most frequently seen patients, or both I guess. But don’t think for a moment that variants wouldn’t slow way the hell down if everyone would get the vaccines. It would. Because you’d stop infecting ME. And THAT would be where you’d REALLY knock COVID out. If I’m not sick for an extended time, wow. You’ve just really taken away the prime way that this virus continues to mutate at such an astronomical pace.  And bonus, you’re way less likely to end up in your own ICU, bogging down your coworkers, and way WAY less likely to be taking that last chance to live ECMO from people like me.   To have my own selfish asshole moment, I deserve that bed and that ECMO more. I got my vaccines. I felt like shit afterwards. I feel like shit after my flu vaccine every year. Same with my pneumonia vaccine. Maybe I didn’t get many or any antibodies BUT I TRIED.   If you are too stupid to understand science and how basic shit like vaccines work, I don’t want you to be giving me health advice.

Could it potentially have a long term side effect? yes.  at your age of 24 you should be ok to handle a covid infection, but then again the ""media"" keeps reporting that young and healthy unvaccinated adults are dying from covid.

Dont know if I can say it was a ""pain"" the feeling around heart

So I went to doctor, she told me it CANT be because of vaccine, she did blood tests, everything fine, then I went to cardiologist, she found nothing, that my heart is healthy af.. I had similar symptoms as with myocarditis. and yet they found nothing, so I went home cause just body is ""adjusting"" to vaccine.

So I went also for second vaccine, and everything continued, I dont have the really fast heart beating anymore, but on day to day basis I feel my heart that something is ""there"", like light pressure beneath it. I am going to pay for tests on my own right now...  we will see...

The pain faded out a little, but it was still really bad at times. I got the second shot mid November. The pain started to get a lot worse after this. I once again visited my GP and he ordered a blood test and a breast ultrasound. The blood test said that my iron levels were borderline low, but nothing too bad. The breast ultrasound was also normal. The pain continued for another 2 months. I also experienced shortness of breath and occasional back pain. The pain spiked sometimes and got worse. Eventually, in January I once again visited my GP, and he took things more seriously this time. He ordered an ECG and a heart muscle blood test. I done the tests and the heart muscle test seemed mostly fine, but the ECG was abnormal. It showed a right bundle branch block/arrhythmia. The GP referred me to a cardiologist and my booking is next week.

"No, you still have immunologic memory. The problem (to vastly oversimplify) comes from the fact that memory is established in the blood, and memory cells circulate in the blood. When the memory cells encounter the antigen again it triggers a new wave of immune cells in the blood, which pump out the primary defensive antibody, IgG. (Lots of other stuff going on, but that’s level one.)  Covid is at least initially a respiratory virus. It enters through the respiratory mucosa, which is defended by IgA, not IgG. IgA is stimulated by vaccines (and infection) but it doesn’t have much memory, so it fades with time. Your memory cells in the bloodstream aren’t awakened until they learn about the infection, but by that point, you’ve got it. But on the flip side, that’s why the vaccines are more effective at mitigating the more dangerous vascular symptoms. We can fight it much more effectively in the blood.   As of January 2020, no one had ever developed a vaccine that establishes stable true immunity to a respiratory virus. That’s still true. No one had ever developed a very effective vaccine to a coronavirus at all. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both exceeded expectations (the expectations of biologists who understand vaccines).

Meanwhile the US buries their head in the sand and this overwhelms the health services. We get 4-5x the % of the population infected that China has, and we spend many more months trying to get hospitals back to normal. The higher death rate impacts citizens and businesses more seriously than in China, with mortgage defaults, medical bankruptcies, and childcare complications. A deeper recession takes hold.

"You are not protecting just them.

But those low odds are significant because of the wide circulation of the virus because not everyone got vaccinated, in US and in other countries where you or other people of US travel to.

"Culturally, Japan is very communal, and masks have been worn by people that are sick there for a long time (pre COVID) to protect others for getting sick.  They are generally compliant with mask wearing due to this history and have not politicized the issue.  Americans are the exact opposite, rugged individualism is part of the DNA, people feel the right to do what they want, and many want government out of their lives.  Add in the US leadership has not had a cohesive message that is focusing on facts and data, and that leadership made masks a partisan issue (and have not served as good examples for the people), leaning into that individualism.  This has gone so far as to now have people that have been tested positive, refusing to cooperate with contract tracing.  Citizens of the US are refusing to participate in the good for the entire society.  Our individualism is in the way.    All that gets us here, and is why this will continue much longer that it could have.

"I'm not an expert by any means but I'd like to try to help!  The only corners we ""cut"" during the development of this vaccine were actually things that were researched ahead of time - Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA vaccine delivery technique was already patented and proved safe for human use over the course of several years of study, they just didn't have a disease to actually vaccinate for using this method until COVID came along.  Similarly with the vaccines not using the mRNA delivery method, those were made using delivery systems that had been proven safe and are in use for other related diseases like the flu shot.  That cut about 12-16 months or so off of the time it would have taken to get a vaccine approved.  Most of the rest of the ""cut"" corners were in manufacturing time: instead of saving money by only manufacturing just enough vaccine to get through testing, then setting up the infrastructure for mass production, vaccine companies went whole hog on producing and stockpiling the vaccine so that it would be ready to deliver to the mass market the second the FDA approved it.  The only last corner cut was actually genuinely cut: waiting to see how long immunity from the vaccine will last.  The only way to know that would have been to wait several years to see if any of the vaccinated test subjects come down with COVID years down the line.  Because of the time we're in, the scientists and powers that be decided that **possibly** short-term immunity for everyone RIGHT NOW is more important than **possibly** longer-lasting immunity by changing up the vaccine somehow.  Even with this, we are not in the dark, because we know that the closely related SARS virus has a 2-3 year window of immunity to catching the disease again.  The major concerns about dose effectiveness, side effects, and dangers of vaccinating have all been carefully studied over the last few months.  We really will be safe taking this vaccine when it comes out, it will be fine if we all need to get boosters every year or every few years, and when the immediate pressure is off there may be a longer-lasting vaccine available that will be safe as well.   Hope this helps!  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Edit: quick addition that we do not actually know how safe this vaccine is for children under 18, but that is because the legal and ethical standards for testing medicine on children is very high!  Now that we know the vaccine is save for a wide range of ages of adults, there are going to be further tests to make sure it is safe for younger and younger age groups.  The first step is figuring out if 12-17 year olds can take it.  This should not stop adults from getting the vaccine in the meantime, and adults spread COVID more and are more affected by it so prioritizing the vaccination of adults makes perfect sense.  The vaccine is safe, and I can't wait to take it!",2020-12-03 3:15
"If this were the black death the people would be demanding a vaccine and blaming their government for letting them die by the millions. They would be fighting over a spot for the vaccine because life is generally better than death.  There is a real solid chance mathematically that you are alive today as a direct result of a vaccine. Being forced to take it shouldn't even be an issue. That's just being stubborn because you can be and risking your life while you do it.  It's like those idiots who walk around town with their assault rifles to provoke the cops into a response so they can affirm their rights to do so. Yes they are legally right but it's still risking their life to prove a point.  The real question is.. What part about taking the vaccine has you worried? Vaccination is proven to work beyond a doubt through history and no one can deny that.  I think that the government should mandate that all vaccinations for pandemic like events be required. Because it's not only your life you are risking its others around you.  The government also demands that you drive the speed limit. By your logic this is the government telling you what you can and can't do with your body and property. One person not getting vaccinated goes to the gas station and everyone else who want vaccinated because ""I got rights"" could end up catching it and dieing. This could lead to hundreds more deaths because ""I got rights"". This isn't you just risking your life. It's you risking other people's lives.  I personally believe that anyone who refuses to take it.. If that's an option should be held accountable at that point for who they infect. If contact tracing traces an infection back to you.. And that spread killed 15 people.. That should be 15 counts of manslaughter.  So if that was an option.. Like.. You can refuse but you are accountable for any positive cases that come from you..

"28M. 9 months of epididymo-orchitis here (right testicle) - started 2 weeks after I received my 2nd dose of AstraZeneca, at the end of June 2021 (which makes me think that's a side effect of it).

Been to 2 different urologists and 3 ultrasounds. Ultrasounds showed everything looks normal, besides that I have epididymo-orchitis. Urologists did urine, semen and blood tests too - no bacteria, infections or tumour markers were found (been with the same partner for 10 years anyway). Hormone and testosterone levels are normal too. Sperm levels are extremely low, but this is likely caused by a surgery I had as a child (undescended testicles) and I've already accepted my infertility. It also never caused me any problems before the epididymitis started 9 months ago anyway.

No antibiotics were prescribed as there is no infection. They just told me to take ibuprofen when it hurts, or if it continues, they ""can try cipro"". Needless to explain, i said NO. Ibuprofen eases the pain, but it usually comes back shortly after.

Symptoms :pain comes when I sit or lay in bed for long period of times. When I am standing or walking the pain is non-existent. Epididymitis is thick , as well as the bottom of my right testicle (feels like the surface is harsh and I often get sharp 1-2 seconds of very bad pain there, accompanied with itching too). After ejaculation, the pain is briefly relieved, but then it starts again on the next day.

I am fortunate to have enough money saved to get through a month or so of bills, but this is going to be a hard time for most adults who live paycheck to paycheck.

I think people having asthma attacks (like, currently having an attack) are allowed to take their mask off until it subsides too.

But my family like mom and grandma and aunt all are very right wing conservative, and at the time my mom and stepdad were going down the Quanon rabbit hole. 

I will say that before the shots, I really did not have much health problems. I mean, I had anxiety, and panic attacks. But like a year or so after getting the shots, my health kind of went down- I got diagnosed with Intracranial Hypertension, Papilledema, Optic Nerve swelling, depression, and the doctors thought I had some heart problem like a fib, and I’ve gone to heart doctors and done stress tests, echocardiograms, but turned out I have POTS. I just got diagnosed with POTS a few days ago. 

My family had told me when I got diagnosed with the first health problem, that “the shot was a dumb idea” or “you don’t know what’s in that shot, it could be harmful to you” and continued to spew the  stuff that mainstream news says like fox and cnn. I just ignored it for the most part. However I decided to just do some of my own research because it’s apparent that my health has gone down and changed since I got the shot. But idk if the shot IS the reason why but from doing my research I did find out that there’s a possible link between POTS and Covid shot but idk I feel like it could be a coincidence? Hmm, 🧐 What do you think? 

TLDR; was healthy before the covid shot, and about a year after the shot I began having health issues, and recently got diagnosed with POTS and family thinks the covid shot is what caused the health problems I now have. What do you think? 🤔 ",2025-04-11 11:33

"I am a fool. I am an idiot. I have been working out for ninety minutes a day for three days in a row. I needed to get my vaccine. It was time to finally bite the bullet. I grabbed myself by the trypanophobic nutsack and got myself a next day appointment. 

So. I work out for ninety minutes and show up freshly showered and on the verge of tears to the rite aid where I’m going to get jabbed. I wanted J&amp;J because needles FREAK me out. And I would back out if I knew I had to get another shot in two weeks. 

Point is. I figure. Huh. Work at 7am the next day? I can do that. That’s fine. It was fine. I slept in a little but made it there when I needed to be. It is now 2 pm. I was pulled into a surprised 14 hours shift and the slowly building headache is agony. My body is shaking and I hurt everywhere. Im not going to leave so uh. Here’s to advil and a gallon of water. 

I have a question. How long until this fades? Am I going to have to work until 9 pm like this?? Then come back at 7am the next day?

Edit: I am pro vax. I have a history of vax reactions according to my anti vax mother. I didn’t get it because the doctor she was taking me to when Covid happened(I was a minor) said I shouldn’t get it.

"Very well articulated, especially for someone your age! I respect that you have really taken the time to study all outcomes and theoretical possibilities.   >the vaccine has been repeatedly proved to harm a person's body and immune system, instead of fortifying it. It is not producing antibodies right. Any positive effects also wear of within months, so boosters will be essential. However, the vaccine is only targeting the spike of the virus. This allows the virus room to mutate and get around people's immune defenses. Rather, if your body fights off the virus, it is killed, and you gain resilience and immunity.   This could indeed cause a problem long term, as Geert Vanden Bossche theorizes; in the case of mass vaccinations leading to vaccine resistant variants, we could be in a bad position due to an inability to sterilize the virus upon infection. Moreso, I'm not sure about the spike protein ""harming a person's immune system"", though, in a scenario where the vaccine becomes ineffective due to a more resilient mutation - the existing memory from the S protein may impede our ability to create a new defensive immune response to the new variation of virus. The same could occur to an attenuated vaccine, if one is made in the future, rendering it incapable of producing immunity in previously vaccinated individuals. (Note: I don't know the likelihood of attenuated vaccines being produced in the near future).  As for harming your body: it's true that a circumstance of this variation of mrna vaccines, unfortunately seems to be that the lipid nanoparticles used to transport the messenger rna to your cells (which then create the spike protein, for your immune system to learn from), don't stay where they should. The issue being that in the event that spike protein is produced by other cells in your body i.e. brain, spinal chord, ovaries etc, your immune system will begin to target and eliminate otherwise healthy and necessary cells in your body.   For this reason, alot of people are very hopeful about novavax, which uses moth cells to multiply a version of baculovirus which is modified to include the spike protein. Though, it doesn't have the same level of data as the other vaccines and it uses the very same spike protein, this method of delivery could be safer, especially for younger age groups.   But very well written. I hope you continue to grow, learn and use your talents to find interests, happiness and success for yourself!   - By the way, lockdowns are very tough mentally. Try to exercise, even if it's just a few sit ups, pushups and pull ups or some running or football.. and get as much sun as possible.

I had to argue one day for an alternative to opioids for a pt with gastric sleeve and NSAID induced PUD,  because they would’ve cover ANYTHING reasonable like lidocaine patches, voltaren gel, lyrica, but gladly would let us write for 90 Norco and have the patient just ileus their way into the hospital the next week. I seriously keep the pdfs of every updated formulary I can find open on my computer at all times, prescribe 99% generic drugs, except when there is not that option or when a insurance plan randomly decides that they only allow the brand name to be covered. Yes , it’s a real thing, and it’s stupid as fuck. They’ve called and wanted me to rewrite the prescription as “brand name medically necessary”.

"So I watched the videos and more importantly read the sources that they cited. The concern they raise is that the spike protein in SARS–CoV–2 prevents the body from forming a strong immune response which is why people with severe cases of covid often don't have strong immunity. The conclusion of the study is that vaccines using the full spike protein may be less effective, not that they will be dangerous. They suggest that a vaccine using partial spike proteins would possibly be more effective because they wouldn't inhibit the bodies immune response in the same way. However, this is an in vitro study, not a study on actual living humans. Studies on live humans have shown that the vaccines are very effective and safe (not 100% effective or safe but the benefits significantly outweigh the risks).     Additionally, any risks associated with the spike protein also apply to if you get covid. And while the vaccines only effect as small number of your cells and are quickly eliminated from your body, covid can spread widely within your body causing much more damage.",2021-11-16 21:59

"> **Background and Objectives:**  >  > After recovering from COVID-19, patients may experience persistent symptoms, known as post-COVID-19 syndrome or long COVID, which include a range of continuing health problems. This research explores the prevalence, associated factors, and overall health outcomes of long COVID during a period of extensive vaccination and antiviral treatment availability in Thailand.  >  > **Materials and Methods:** This observational study involved 390 adult patients with COVID-19 between January and March 2022. Beginning three months after their diagnosis, these patients were interviewed via telephone every three months for a period of one year. The data collection process included gathering demographic information and administering a standardized questionnaire that addressed the patients’ physical condition following COVID-19, their mental health, sleep disturbances, and overall quality of life.  >  > **Results:**  >  > The cohort consisted of 390 participants, with an average age of 31.8 ± 13.6. Among them, 96.7% (n = 377) were vaccinated, and 98.2% (n = 383) underwent antiviral treatment. Long-COVID prevalence was observed at 77.7%, with the most frequently reported symptoms being fatigue (64.1%) and cough (43.9%). Regarding mental health, depression was reported by 8.2% of the participants, anxiety by 4.1%, and poor sleep quality by 33.3%. Advanced statistical analysis using multivariable logistic regression showed significant links between long-COVID symptoms and patients aged below 60 (p = 0.042), as well as the initial symptom of cough (p = 0.045). In the subset of long-COVID sufferers, there was a notable correlation in females with symptoms such as headaches (p = 0.001), dizziness (p = 0.007), and brain fog (p = 0.013). >  > **Conclusions:** Despite the extensive distribution of vaccines and antiviral therapies, the prevalence of long COVID remains high, being associated particularly with individuals under 60 and those exhibiting a cough as an early symptom. The study further reveals that mental health issues related to long COVID are profound, going beyond the scope of physical symptomatology.",2024-03-01 2:38

"28M, double vaxxed and got my booster late November 2021 (all Moderna). Had Covid late May-early June 2022 (most likely BA.2.1.12), mild case and fully recovered.

I’m hesitant to get this new booster for a few reasons: 1) they feel rushed to the public without much data behind them; 2) the data that is available doesn’t indicate that it prevents transmission; and 3) a new variant could arise at any time that makes these boosters irrelevant.

I want to follow the science, but I also don’t want to fall into a pattern where I’m getting multiple boosters a year that are consistently behind the virus’ evolution and ultimately don’t do much. I can tolerate getting a shot once per year like the flu, but anything more than that feels excessive, especially since the side effects from the initial shots and booster hit me HARD and knocked me out for multiple days each time.

Does anyone else share my hesitations? I want a reason to get another booster, but I’m having a hard time finding one.",2022-09-07 12:19

"> If >2% of the population is already infected, it's all over except the actual dying part.  ABSOLUTELY NOT.  Flattening the Curve is about slowing the rate that most of us get it. And if we slow it enough with social distancing measures (there's a 17 day delay between measures and effect on the curve), then our hospitals can keep up and the fatality rate stays under 1%.   If the hospitals crash (as they are definitely going to in the US, because we haven't yet seen strong enough social distancing, plus the 17 day lag), then the fatality rate skyrockets.

"There are no promising vaccines and vaccines are not cures.  We don't even have any safety data on them yet.  The US going this quickly into human trials is the most disgraceful thing I have ever seen the medical community due in 40 years.   There is hydroxychoroquine, Remdesivir, Quercetin, and ritonavir and lopinavir  All of these have verified anecdotal evidence verified from multiple sources.  All of these have clinical trials behind them showing them to be effective against different viruses.  We have varying degrees of safety data backed up by clinical trials on all of these drugs.    Is it the gold standard? No.  However given the circumstances the right move is to put these into action.  Belgium started doing it last week.  I bet you out of all of the western world Belgium will fare the best unless we ditch this clinical trial religion.   All of the countries that have this under control are using some of these treatment methods.    These drugs show a reduction in viral load in patients far faster than seen in subjects where the immune system fights it off alone.  4-6 days to see 100% reduction in the virus... with 75% of the subjects not having any detectable virus.  The remaining subjects with less than 25% of the virus they previously tested with.  Science isn't the end all be all.  It is not God.  Logic and Math are equally important if not more important than science.    Western medicine gives advice that says we shouldn't be wearing a mask in this pandemic as the public.  Clinical trials don't support the notion they protect you from getting the virus.    So you might get the virus.  We have studies that show that reducing the viral load will lessen the severity of the illness caused by bacteria and/or viruses.    We know that this virus is contagious during the asymptomatic period.  You could be spreading it without even knowing it.  Therefore everyone should wear a mask unless they know they are immune to the virus.    We should be making our own masks at home.  Wearing them every time we're out side and all the time inside a home with a suspected infected individual.   When logic can be used to destroy the ""advice"" science based western medicine puts out.   It's an indication that western medicine is not science based and is a dogmatic religion.   Game theory (Math) tell us our best course of action was to begin using the most safety tested treatments mentioned above weeks ago.  Worst case scenario in using the drugs along side the known well tested safety trials the drugs do not work and produce no significant harm to the patients.  This could have been done with a massive trial essentially randomizing the various treatments in many different arms to find out which is the best.  A well designed study could have produced data that would indicate treatment decisions in real time.  As the study progressed Arms could have been closed out and moved to the most promising treatment arm.    If any of the arms proved to be effective combined with social distancing our medical systems throughout most of the western world could have been dealing with a smaller number of patients.  Now we're facing most medical systems facing imminent overrun in the next few weeks and no tools to use it.  Hopefully Remdesivir's trial was constructed well and ran well.  Its the earliest trial I am aware of and the results are expected April 1st.  My understanding is production of the drug is already underway so hopefully by the first week in April we'll have it out there working on patients.",2020-03-23 20:55

"I've seen so many posts on Reddit and on social media about how people can't stand the unvaccinated. And look at us in disgust. Like we are the plague. And it's like many people don't even look at us like we are human with actual feelings and legitimate reasons behind our reservations. They only see selfish anti vaxer and that's it. For me it's fear of the potential severe side effects that could show up now or years from now. I've had other vaccines and I felt more comfortable taking those since they've been around for so long, but the COVID vaccine gives me extreme anxiety to the point where I have panic attacks just thinking about getting the vaccine. Even though I know there is minimal risk for severe reactions. But for me, I believe there is also minimal risk of me getting really sick from COVID since I've had it before with very minimal illness. Along with being exposed to COVID from my husband without knowing it and I didn't catch it. Despite being around him a lot in close proximity all day long. So when I weigh the risk for myself, I believe my own immune response is handling the virus pretty well. This is just my PERSONAL belief. Not saying this should apply to everyone.

And for those who think all of us unvaccinated are inconsiderate/ selfish, some of us do take precautions.  When the CDC reports that COVID numbers in my area is going up or if I'm around someone who is high risk, I wear a mask to try and prevent spreading COVID in case I was to have it without knowing it. That makes me feel more comfortable since I can take the mask off. Whereas a vaccine is more long term. I can't just take it out. 

I'm not trying to encourage anyone not to take the COVID vaccine. I'm not spreading misinformation. I'm only speaking for myself and only me. I actually would encourage people to take the vaccine if they feel that's the best decision for them. But I also believe other people who don't feel comfortable taking the vaccine should not be shamed for it. (*Also believe people shouldn't be shamed FOR getting the vaccine from the unvaccinated as well.) I think it's pretty ridiculous that people are shaming people that genuinely don't feel comfortable injecting something in their body without knowing how it's going to effect them. And I wish people wouldn't automatically assume the worst about someone because they didn't get the COVID shot and not lump us all into the same category of antivaxers. Before we shame the unvaccinated, we don't know everyone personally and how this COVID vaccine really effects them. For me, I take COVID very seriously and have spent a great deal of time thinking over what would be the best decision for my situation.

***If you're going to downvote I would love to hear your actual opinion rather than just downvoting because I have a different opinion than you. This is exactly what I mean.

"I’m a 34F, struggle with severe anxiety/panic/agoraphobia, which has worsened since the pandemic started last year. I also have pretty bad asthma that gets worse in the spring. My mother lives with me, she has a heart condition and I spend a lot of time around my older grandmothers as well. I was hesitant to get the shot, and anxious as hell about even going into a store (Walgreens) let alone to get a brand new vaccine. 

First shot, I pushed through the panic, my first time in a store in over a year, and got the shot. The process didn’t hurt at all, but I did have a bit of panic immediately following the shot that caused my heart rate to jump up. The next day I had some brain fog and felt very achy. Anxiety was high for a week after, all the what if’s rolling around in my brain didn’t help. 2 weeks out I was still anxious and hyper focused on any little change in my body. I was fine but my mental health told me otherwise. 

Second shot, 3 days ago. Anxiety had kept me on high alert the whole week before the shot. All the one off horror stories online kept me awake at night. When I got the shot I played some calming music on my headphones and asked the nurse to not tell me right after the shot so I wouldn’t panic. She waited for a few minutes to pass, then told me it was done. No jump in heart rate, I was fine. 

4 hours after the second shot I started getting nauseous, achy and sweaty. I waited a while, then took some Tylenol for my achy arm. No fever 

12 hours after- woke up with a severely swollen lymph node under my injection arm. I couldn’t put any pressure on it at all, even the weight of my arm hurt. I took some more Tylenol. Sweaty, tired, dizzy and nauseous. Laid in bed and tried to distract myself with some Netflix but I was restless. No fever.

24 hours after- very sore arm and lymph node. Sweating buckets. I always am super hydrated but I kept downing water and pedialyte. Felt well enough to get up and play with my dog for about ten minutes and then I was spent again. Still no fever. 

48 hours after- decided to take some Advil for the swollen lymph node. Immediately started feeling better a few hours later. Still anxious, sweaty and nauseous. 

Woke up today and I feel AMAZING. I don’t know if it was all the sleep or the Advil, but I haven’t felt this good in a long time. Lymph node is still tender but the swelling has gone way down. So much relief in knowing it is all done. 

I’m excited to get back to where I was pre-pandemic, eating dinner with family, going into stores to shop, and eventually traveling once it is safe to do so. 

To anyone who has anxiety, let me just say it is worth it. I am probably the most anxious person around, I am hypersensitive to everything, and have obsessive health thoughts/worries. But knowing that in two weeks if I do get covid I won’t die, that is worth the whole rollercoaster of getting this shot.

Americans simply can not afford to not got to work, which clearly places them in a situation where they are around other humans more than most and so the virus can get around. Unlike in Europe, they'll be homeless in the event they do not go to work.

"I am very curious to know a bit more about how vaccines work (ideally in a ""i lost the game show are you smarter than a 5th grader"" way)

My understanding, albeit simplified, has always been that a vaccine basically gives you a ""template"" of sorts that matches the illness it's preventing. The template would also have either the answer key to defeating the illness or like a really good study guide to defeating it. So then if you are introduced to that illness in a less controlled environment you're body doesn't have to figure out how to fight it from scratch. And then if you get some symptoms from a vaccine its because the template is super similar to the real thing and your body is getting on hands on work experience by practicing defeating the illness. 

The reason i ask about all this is because i have had,  in the past, symptoms caused by vaccines. I recently though got a tdap booster in my left arm and flu & covid in my right. Tdap i was told would likely be the most sore/symptom provking but it is virtually painless and symptom free. The covid and flu though has its usual sorness and symptoms. 

I know having no symptoms after getting a vaccine is not a bad thing but it did make me go down the rabbit hole of wondering if post-vaccine pain/symptoms would ever correlate to how effective a vaccine is? I would love some articles or studies on this if anyone knows of any, just for pure curiosities sake. but if at all possible, snippets of articles/guidance on where to look/summaries/etc. Would be very much appreciated as my reading comprehension level seems to plummet through the floor when i am reading any sort of academic research. 

For reference:
- i get covid & flu every year since ive been able. 
- Dtap set of 5 doses was from 2002(birth yr)-2007(this is so spread out due to other life happenings)
-  last Tdap booster was 2013 (i had whooping cough around this time so the booster was a bit earlier than 10 years)

But afterwards, from January onwards, it's hard to overstate how useful the journal articles those overworked doctors published are, or how important the country-wide actions were. They form the basis of the treatment regime of Covid-19, and much of what we know about it. That it spread relatively slowly once Wuhan was locked down means that plenty of governments had time *and information*, which China didn't when it first broke, to prepare for it. Ever since it broke, China health authorities + citizens have been screaming from the rooftops to be prepared when or if it hits.  Some countries prepared. Most didn't.",2020-03-23 2:12

"I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease after getting an influenza shot, less than 40 days later I lost consciousness  on my way to work. I woke up in hospital with my kids and wife at my side.  Here are a few points which can give you ideas for your book :  It is very unlucky but it can happen for many reasons including vaccine as well. For some reason which are not yet very well known your autoimmune system decides to overreact and start attacking tissues which it is not supposed to.  One of reasons why some people are dying of covid-19 is because at time of death even though the virus load is 0% the immune system went a bit crazy...  There are many things which can trigger an autoimmune disease(virus, bacteria, stress, vaccine, allergy), about 20 years ago the Hepatitis B vaccine was removed on some countries because it seemed like it would trigger an autoimmune reaction much more than what was anticipated. It took more than 10 years of thorough study to show that it was not the case for some countries like France to reintroduce it.  For your book one scenario idea could be a rna vaccine which is using transcriptase inverse using some enzyme which was not identified before to modify some gene which would produce some defect in white blood cells :-)  Note 1: I got vaccinated for covid-19, and even though my condition got triggered likely by a vaccine in the past I always consider the benefice risk and talk with my Neurologist knowing that getting a vaccine will also potentially have some negative effects.

Sera obtained from 37, 30 and 30 XBB.1.5, BA.1 and BA.4-5 -vaccine recipients, respectively, were tested for anti-RBD IgG and for JN-1 specific neutralizing antibody levels. Geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) in JN.1 specific neutralizing titers was 27 (95 % CI: 17–43.1), 10.1 (95 % CI: 6.48–15.7) and 8.77 (95 % CI: 5.69–13.5) following XBB.1.5, BA.1 and BA.4-5 vaccines, respectively, translating into a 64 % lower adjusted response (geometric mean ratio [GMR] = 0.36, 95 % CI: 0.21–0.6) in the BA.1 arm, and a 75 % lower response (GMR = 0.25, 95 % CI: 0.15–0.43) in the BA.4-5 arm.

Our new shut down is also supposed to only last through november to surpress cases to a level where we can have a somewhat normal christmas. That doesn't look too good either right now. We got a compromise where schools, churches and retail remain open and only restaurants, hotel, sports and leisure activity are shut down. So basically work, school and nothing else for a month.  New cases are still rising, just slower than before, percentage wise.  So christmas without lockdown is out the window if you look at it realistically.

"Aug 28, 2024:        **Highlights:**    - XBB.1.5 monovalent (MV) booster elicits neutralizing titers up to 6 months after dose      - Titers wane more slowly after XBB.1.5 MV booster than after BA.5 bivalent booster      - XBB.1.5 MV booster partially mitigates immunological imprinting      **Summary**   Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-neutralizing antibodies are substantially expanded 1 month after a shot of XBB.1.5 monovalent mRNA vaccine (XBB.1.5 MV) booster, but the durability of this response remains unknown. Here, we address this question by performing neutralization assays on four viral variants (D614G, BA.5, XBB.1.5, and JN.1) using sera from participants obtained at ∼1 month, ∼3 months, and ∼6 months post an XBB.1.5 MV booster. Our findings indicate that the resulting neutralizing antibody titers are robust and generally remain at stable levels for the study period, similar to those following XBB infection. Importantly, this durability of neutralizing antibody titers contrasts with the decline observed after a booster of the original monovalent or BA.5 bivalent mRNA vaccine. Our results are in line with the recent national data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, showing that the efficacy against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is sustained for up to 4 months after an XBB.1.5 MV booster.",2024-09-04 7:33

"Thanks for your response. Don't worry, you didn't offend at all. I apologize if I gave that impression as well. Thank you so much for all the hard work and direct patient care you do. I can't tell you how much it makes our jobs easier and is appreciated.  As to what you were saying, I have seen quite a lot of support specific to nurses and non-physician healthcare workers myself. Sometimes to me it feels like nurses get all the appreciation from the public. *Everyone* feels like their branch of healthcare isn't getting the appreciation they deserve. Trust me. I've heard it in every which way and direction.  Truth is everyone is working so hard themselves that they don't have to time to look up and see how much their colleagues are hustling as well.  I understand what you mean with people not involved with direct covid care. I don't think a forgiveness bill like this would pass regardless, especially one that isn't targeted towards active, frontline healthcare workers.  Also, the ED is a different beast entirely for sure. Speed is everything. Those docs have to quickly decide whether this patient stays, goes, or is held to be watched. Need to know what to do, ask, or test to decide that. Also need to get the right tests or give the right drugs so when they do admit to a team that team doesn't immediately start complaining about how this urgent thing wasn't done.  In my view it is unfair to say that ER docs are worth less because of how little time they spend with patients because their speed ***is*** their skill. The experience and knowledge-base that only they have is what allows them to spend just 5min with a patient and know what to do. Someone else in that position in a time crunch could miss something that completely changes everything - what looks like a standard admit or discharge for xyz that you could do in your sleep is suddenly a big fucking deal.  That's what they get paid to do and to be. I don't like a system that needs and incentivizes that kind of lightning fast care. Personal, humanistic care is important beyond the bottom line. But it's the system we have.  We shouldn't think less of colleagues who are performing the exact skills we demand of them. Especially when those skills are extremely difficult and take years of education and training to master.",2020-05-06 17:22

Europe has a population of 740 million (sorry I don't know if that's EU or the whole continent) which is slightly more than double the US.

"TLDR: WHO's TAG-CO-VAC recommends the switch from bivalent boosters to a monovalent formulation containing a XBB.1 descendant lineage for fall to winter boosters.

"This doesn’t read like a genuine question, but here’s a genuine answer: 1. If you contract COVID again, you are a greater threat. How the mRNA vaccine works is it enables the body to fight the the virus by preventing it from latching on, multiplying, and overloading your system. The greater the viral load, the greater the spread. Those who are vaccinated are not spreading COVID at the same rate as those who are unvaccinated. That is a fact. So the greater good is still on the table and children who can’t get vaccinated are among them. We do know how the current vaccines protect against the Delta variant. For example, Pfizer is 88% effective against the Delta variant, as opposed to a 94% efficacy rate against the alpha variant. Still excellent odds.  2. You don’t know which variant you had. You’re guessing. The Delta variant (thanks to those of you who have not been vaccinated) is now mutating again into a new and improved strain which will again put you at greater risk.  Get vaccinated and in the mean time wear a mask. For your health and the health of those around you. It’s that simple. We no longer deal with polio because vaccines work. COVID is no different, save a science denying population that is providing hosts like yourself for this virus to infect, mutate and continue to spread.  I’m sorry if I seem frustrated.

"Because words are fucking important. Socialism in common discourse brings imagery of countries like the USSR, Venezuela, and other failures. Saying that Democratic socialism is the same as socialism is a tool used to scare people away from any program that seeks to take the profit motive from one or two failing industries (e.g. healthcare and education). When you say ""Democratic socialism is socialism"" someone has already decided that everything associated with a Democratic Socialism platform will lead to bread lines and death. There are essentially zero Americans that want to completely removed capitalism from every industry. We want to fix the systems oligarchy-run industries that provide human rights. That is not the same as controlling the entire economy through community ownership.   When you say that policies are socialism, people who don't know more and are unwilling to research them flock to the right.

In what world would that even remotely have been a good idea  besides, everyone wearing masks isn't even close to being the most effective way to prevent transmission, this is droplet spread not airborne and surgical masks do very little to prevent aerosolized transmission, unless everyone had N95's but thank god that isn't happening",2020-04-02 20:59

"So, I've had both rounds of pfizer, fully Dec 1 2021. 

I've been having some really strange issues sense.

Random numbness/tingling at different points in the days. This could be anywhere from sleeping and waking up to pain and numbness/tingling on one side/both of my body. While standing/walking one side falling asleep. Numbness in my face during the day, my eye twitches a lot randomly. I've been really tired lately and my muscles are always sore, almost to the point of exhaustion.

Sometimes I have issues gripping things, randomly drop stuff.

I've made it a point to drink more water, thinking the soreness could be from possible dehydration.

Nothing has changed, no medicine changes or anything like that, there's been a couple more problems, but those are the most concerning.

"> We are less sure in our understanding of how to deal with coronavirus as a disease than we are sure in understanding the economic effect of it.  I think the opposite. We have all seen this disease thing play out hundreds of times.  It is bad, then they find some treatments that help, then eventually they get a vaccine that tamps the disease all the way out.  The first vaccine trials for COVID-19 just started.  On the economic front we just passed into totally uncharted territory.  We have NEVER shut down our own economy before on purpose.  Never. We have never before chosen to wipe out every last restaurant at the same time as every nail salon, barber, all the lowest income workers in America just got boned at the same time. We do know the “reboot” is extremely difficult from the few examples of recessions and 1 Great Depression.  So hard it is unclear what works.  The Great Depression required the largest war the world has ever seen for the US to recover - bomb the factories in Europe into the Stone Age and leave the US factories untouched to fill in the void.  I honestly have no idea what to do, but I am terrified of what we just did to the economy.  When you get 30% unemployment of young men age 18-25 governments topple.  Can you imagine how bad this is going to go when the starvation begins?  People can usually survive about 6 weeks without food, so we are ok for a little while, but I think we are about to see a lot of suicides and violence after that.

That’s doesn’t make him a controversial president. It makes his administration and by extension him flawed.   He’s still widely liked by most of the world despite the 536 civilians that died as a result of US army drone strikes. At least he had the guts to tell everyone and disclose his mistakes. Trunk recently made the reporting of civilian deaths from military operations non essential. What a lovely precedent to set.   You can play the dead children card with any president and drone strikes will continue to get higher and higher year by year do some time yet.it doesn’t take away from my point.

"mRNA has been studied for the last 50 or so years, and mRNA vaccines have been more recently studied as early as 2010 with clinical trials for influenza beginning 2015. There are plenty of foods, drinks, etc that human ingest that can also be cancerous, yet many ignore that. The COVID vaccine is one that reduces the spread of the virus significantly (yes, you can still get it, but at a much lower rate). The purpose of getting it isn't JUST to protect you, but also protect others as much as possible, especially ones who can't protect themselves (e.g. children/toddlers/babies).  Many argue the long term unknowns effects of the vaccine, but ignore the long term unknowns of the virus itself. My advice would be - listen to the scientists and doctors, not necessarily what you read online. If you're a nurse, talk to the doctors that specialize in internal medicine or infectious diseases. Get 2nd and 3rd opinions. And stop listening to people online with their anecdotal stories about vaccine illnesses or effects that may not even be true at all.",2021-11-20 3:38

"**1.  There's really no point in debating this with you if you refuse to recognize the institutional failings that are massively inflating the cost of education for students today, particularly for medical school students.** -  I thought we are having a discussion.  No need to direct such an attack on me  **2.  For students who aren't born rich, becoming a doctor should not come down to a binary choice of ""take on hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt or don't become a doctor.""  Not having the money on hand to pay for medical school isn't some indication of poor choices or moral failings that would warrant punishment.** -  I've never made this about moral failing.  I am presenting this issue as an adult making an important, life changing decision about a career choice.  These decisions have benefits and consequences.  The price of medical school was not hidden from your wife.  She was told very clearly how much she will owe before she even started the first day of school.  She decided to go into it.   -  You don't need to be born rich to go to medical school.  I am a newish graduate myself.  I paid off my med school on my own after I started working.  Most of my classmates paid off of theirs just fine.  We just kept our expenses low and chose a cheaper med school.  My residency colleagues who went to private ones and owed $500,000 probably didn't pay it off yet.  That's their choice.  One can take on debt that is reasonable to his/her financial situation.  State schools are much cheaper and reasonably priced than private schools.  Let's not make all medical school debt the same. -  You're making a straw man argument that somehow I'm supporting the notion that only rich people get to become doctors.  No.  All I'm saying is that if you can't afford the expensive private ones, don't go to that one.  Choose a cheaper option.  If your calling to medicine is so strong that you decide to go regardless of the cost, well, then pay the price.  **3. The federal government mandates that our young doctors spend 3-7 years in residency, forces them to take a well-below-market salary, and further punishes those among them who weren't born rich by refusing to toll the accumulation of interest on federally-held loans. If you care about fairness so much, how is that fair?**  -  Residency hours suck.  You work a lot for little pay.  If you don't like it, fight to change that.  I have nothing against that fight.  I think it's great that you wish to fight that fight.  Just don't conflate these two issues together.  You can ask for your wife to get paid more without having her debt forgiven.  Again, I'm in support of your wife receiving hazard pay.  **4.  Again, less than $400B of the $2.2 trillion stimulus actually went to the people** -  I don't support bailout of the companies either.  Just because that happened doesn't mean I should turn around and say ""free money for everyone.""

It makes me really mad that a dozen of my coworkers had to get sick for our management to take it seriously.  The majority of our staff are older black women, who are in that high risk group. They should have been taking it seriously from the very beginning in my opinion considering our demographics and what our jobs are.",2020-07-15 16:11

I completely forgot about that craziness.   I remember thinking how scary it was that people actually thought that they were magnetized by the vaccine lol. The videos of people sticking forks on their arms were hilarious to watch but also super concerning.   It wouldn't even faze me if it happened today.,2025-09-13 3:30
"How come when all of this started, the medical officials were putting out PSA's calling for the public to stop buying masks as they aren't effective in stopping Covid spread and needed to be saved for doctors/surgeons etc.  But then all of a sudden one day it does a 180 degree flip and the prior research they did discouraging mask use is no longer valid, and masks actually DO stop the virus etc.  It's all part of the New World Order.",2020-11-13 9:04
"so my sister has got fever from her second dose which was in October and that's alright. 2 days ago(writing this 29 April 7 am and she got the dose 27 April 4 pm) she got her booster and symptoms like cold or throat ache started like 1 hour after the vaccine, then like 8 hours later she got fever which had lasted until yesterday night.
my question is was it normal that she got a cold so soon after the dose? because when she went to the vaz site she didn't have any symptom, maybe it happened because she had the flu in incubation period and then the vaccine made it instantly functional? or something like that idk lol

Weird to see this just become a thing. Where I'm from in CT our Walmart requires masks to enter. They even have a guy at the front checking who will deny access if you're not wearing one and nobody seems to mind. Why the hell havent *all* Walmarts made this a thing??,2020-07-15 21:29

"Can I just say - as someone who experienced some pretty rough nerve side effects from my first Moderna dose in Feb, and was terrified, I came to this group to get a better understanding of what was going on and to find others with my similar experience. Talking to other people about what they experienced was truly helpful to understand how people coped physically and mentally. We’re all at about our wits end from the last year and a half with this thing - so the need to feel a sense of community feels stronger than ever now. This used to be how covidvaccinated felt. Empathetic, supportive, etc. 

Somewhere along the line - that changed. 

Now I see people ask just general questions - and it feels like the responders are attacking OP. 

Woman  comes asking about having a longer period post vax and people responding with comments about how she won’t be able to have children, etc. What?! Why can’t it just be that her body is likely inflamed and sending her encouraging words? And maybe encourage her to see her physicians?

People complaining of having some nerve/joint pain - and people commenting about how them getting vaccinated gave them MS or fibromyalgia and their cytokines will be messed up forever. WHAT?! Why can’t it possibly be nerve irritation and you send that person well wishes and maybe what worked for you if you ran into that same side effect?

Please understand that people with questions or concerns about side effects can often be in a vulnerable state - anxious, in pain, etc and the LAST thing people need is inflammatory statements. If you don’t know why someone is reacting how they are - Just say you don’t know and try to be more compassionate. I think this thread could use a little more empathy and a little less gaslighting and doomsday stuff. 

Had this group been like it is now, when I first was searching for answers, it would’ve honestly sent me spiraling. 

Wishing everyone good health ❤️",2021-07-27 21:41

Obviously not. If they did the states that had severe lockdowns and high mask compliance would be doing better than ones without. That is clearly not the case according to this. This virus is going to run it's course like any other virus.,2020-11-12 6:46

"because of science. mask keeps virus particles out (maybe not 100%) from your breathing system. of course, you can still get it when you remove the mask and did not practice hygiene measures like washing hands before and after handling the mask, or washing the face, or changing to clean cloths after getting home, or rubbing your eyes with dirty hands. nobody enforced eye protection wearing so i guess it's much lower risk getting the virus tru the eyes.  also alot of times, bad seal on mask, or using cheap quality masks. now that we have mink variant, we can't be sure we can't get it from animals.",2020-11-12 21:06

"I saw someone whose videos I've watched from time to time on youtube today.  I don't agree with a lot of what she says but she makes me think.  I don't find her too out of line.   However, today she was very upset about the fact that her mother who is elderly took the vaccine and is now ill (not ill really, in so much as it sounds aged related).  She attributes her mother's decline to the vaccine and is convinced that this whole thing was a way for the government to rid themselves of a certain segment of the population.    &#x200B;  She is very angry.  There is low levels of trust in the government (and I would say with good reason unrelated to the vaccine).

"Well not just leadership to be fair, although that’s a big failure for sure. The US system itself also plays a role.   State vs Federal structures, constitution, US bi partisan political system, healthcare costs (people can’t access tests or too scared to go to hospital and racking up huge bills) lack of readily accessed welfare (so people have no choice but to work, or they starve)   Ultimately though yes, it all boils down to leadership in one form or another.   I lived in the US for 3 years (I’m a Kiwi) and I was constantly shocked at how aggressively anti human the whole system was.
