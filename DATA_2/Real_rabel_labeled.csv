mqapcm,"Edit 2: ""‘We’ve reached two important conclusions. Firstly, COVID-19 markedly increases the risk of CVT, adding to the list of blood clotting problems this infection causes. Secondly, the COVID-19 risk is higher than we see with the current vaccines, even for those under 30; something that should be taken into account when considering the balances between risks and benefits for vaccination.’""

Edit: MarketWatch just posted [this article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/blood-clots-as-prevalent-with-pfizer-and-moderna-vaccine-as-with-astrazenecas-report-2021-04-15) about the risk of AZ being the same as Pfizer and Moderna. 

“A study by Oxford University found the number of people who receive blood clots after getting vaccinated with a coronavirus vaccine are about the same for those who get Pfizer PFE, 1.06% and Moderna MRNA, -2.51% vaccines as they are for the AstraZeneca AZN, 1.92% vaccine that was produced with the university's help. According to the study, 4 in 1 million people experience cerebral venous thrombosis after getting the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, versus 5 in 1 million people for the AstraZeneca vaccine. The risk of getting CVT is much higher for those who get COVID-19 -- 39 in a million patients -- than it is for those for get vaccinated. AstraZeneca's vaccine use has been halted or limited in many countries on blood clot concerns.”


I want to start with a TW here to say that I will be talking about *other* blood-clot risk factors that are much higher. So - read with caution if you're the type who will become anxious about every day life knowing the risks of well...living! I suffer from anxiety and health anxiety and was immediately nervous when seeing the news given I received the vaccine a month ago. These statistics really eased my mind. Also, the fact that they're investigating based on 6 reports means any concerns are being taken seriously. Hope this helps calm some fears!

NOTE: if you experience severe headaches, shortness of breath, or extreme limb pain, contact your doctor (if only for peace of mind). Reminder that these symptoms do **not** go away from Advil or being distracted. If that's the case, your symptoms are likely unrelated or due to anxiety.

Background on me: I'm 25F, vaccinated with J&J on 3/14. I have a blood disorder (Thalassemia B) and went off oral BC in Jan 2019 after 5 years on due to migraines with aura which **increase stroke risk!**

Here's some info that I hope will assuage fears:

1. The FDA and CDC are *investigating the possible link.* Correlation does NOT equal causation. Now, we know that the AZ vaccine, which uses similar mechanisms, has a more robust causal link. It's likely they may rule this causal as well. BUT it's important to keep in mind that this has not be determined yet.
2. Health officials have already expressed they expect the pause to be over in just a few days. This is not a recall. Dr. Peter Hotez explained that the pause has less to do with the vaccine itself and more to do with educating health care professionals on how to treat this type of blood clot **should it arise.** The safest time to fly is right after a crash. The whole world is on high alert right now for any adverse reactions. Your doctors have never been more prepared than right now.
3. Now, let's talk numbers. Yes, this is a more rare type of clot that has some contraindications, and we should keep that in mind when discussing statistics. However, per the above, the entire medical community is currently discussing how best to treat it.
4. As a reminder, there have been 6 reported cases of clots out of 6.8M administered vaccines with 1 death. This means there is currently a .00008% chance of a clot occurring and a .00001% chance of death. Will these numbers change? Yes. Likely they will. But it's important to keep in mind the order of magnitude we're discussing.
5. Let's talk non-Covid related blood clot risk first. There is a 2% to 5% chance of developing a blood clot over any humans lifetime. That's ignoring all risk factors. 5 people out of 100 will develop a blood clot just from existing. We're talking about 10,000x the order of magnitude. It's estimated that 100,000 people a year die of blood clots in the U.S. That means in 2018, 3.5% of people who died did so from a blood clot (this is greater than the number of deaths from AIDS, breast cancer, and car accidents combined).
   1. Obesity increases clot risk between 2x and 5x for men and women
   2. Smoking increases clot risk by 23%
6. These cases were all around women in reproductive ages. We do not know what other risk factors may have presented, such as hormonal birth control. Let's talk about women.
   1. The clot risk for women on the pill is 0.3% to 1% over 10 years. That's 1 woman of every 100 that will develop a clot from the pill. This risk is 2 to 6x more than a woman not on hormonal birth control.
   2. Pregnant women have a 0.2% chance of developing a clot. That's 2 women out of 1000 women every year. 8,000 women will develop pregnancy clots this year out of \~4.0M pregnancies. That's compared to 6 women in 6.8M injections so far.
7. Now let's talk about Covid risk.
   1. People in the U.S. under 55 have a 0.3% risk of dying from Covid.
   2. In a study conducted by Thorax, the risk of PE and DVT blood clots in Covid patients was 7.2% and 11.4%, respectively.
   3. 10% of Covid patients experience long-haul symptoms including shortness of breath, fatigue, insomnia, and rapid heart rate
   4. An estimate by Nate Silver that may help put the pros and cons in perspective: ""Say there's a 1 in 100 chance someone acquires COVID because of a delayed vaccine (maybe conservative in the US where spread is still quite high) and a 1 in 150 chance they die from it. That's a 1 in 15,000 chance vs. 1 blood clot death in 7,000,000 doses so far... We also have to consider that the person who gets COVID because of a delayed vaccine will pass her case along to an average of 1 other person given where Rt is in the US right now. So the death rate is actually twice as high as I indicated above.""

h5y6yw7,">about the spike protein of the vaccine leaving the injection site (which it is not meant to do) and settling in the ovaries and testes  Strange that you've heard people saying this because the article you cited states it comes from the biodistribution study but the biodistribution study doesn't show that.  It shows protein at the injection site and liver at 6 hours, injection site only at 24 hours, and gone by day 6.  https://trialsitenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Pfizer-report_Japanese-government.pdf  Page 6.    > I am sure there are concerns of infection also but considering the injections are a very high dosage of the spike protein, if there was any truth in this being an issue then surely the vax is a higher load than the virus.   It's already been shown that with natural infection with the virus, there is up to 15 times more spike protein in circulation than after vaccination and it continues to hang around a lot longer than the vaccine by SIMOA detection.

gbj5uox,"Why wouldn't letting the healthy get it stop the spread? In absolute numbers, the cases will go up, sure.  But the real fear is the vulnerable.  Getting the young infected takes them out of the pool of spreaders when they recover.  A mutation could get around that, sure, so there is no guarantee it will stay the way.   Regardless, even if that were not true, locking down a population has huge economic and personal costs. If the only objective is stopping COVID, then sure, ignore those costs and lockdown.  Because we don't live in a world where we can ignore that, we have to consider where we are taking from the economy to help the public health. I think that letting people balance the risks themselves is the best way to find that out.  I view it very similar to driving in a snow storm.  People look at the risks, and stop driving based on their own risk management.  There doesn't need to be an order, people are naturally interested in self preservation.

The BEST thing for the economy was to sacrifice the working class then when they cant work/die/are let go.. scoop up their houses for pennies on the dollar... this happens like every 10-12 years and its insane how blind people are to it.

He'd buy whole streets... for context.. he sold the highest value piece of land in vegas ever.. all because it was bought during a recession. Hes RED and a multi-multi-multi millionaire.  I'd be surprised if he wasn't actually a multi billionaire better at hiding his real money.. this has been the plan. We get kicked out if our houses/ can't afford it.. then play catchup and lost of us will never be able to after this. They'll come in, they'll scoop up my grandmas house cause she can't afford to work or risk dying anymore.. and then rent it out to us later...     Please note the obvious sarcasm in me saying this is ""BEST"" for the economy.   Also edited to add.. we'll be feeling this for way longer than a few years.. this is going to cripple industries. What happens to all the contractors who do small home improvement things and cant find the work because homeowners literally can't afford to fix it?

ljpk8th,"> but certainly one kind of long-covid is autoantibody response without a pathogen like covid virus present any longer >  > there are numerous papers on that over the past four years  There's some evidence for this.  Is it strong?  Not really.   In fact, one of the people pushing it right now (Iwasaki from Yale...same group as I talked about before), previously found no autoantibodies in the long COVID group (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06651-y) and now, all of a sudden, they have autoantibodies... (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11213106/)  Everybody, healthy or not, has a certain level of autoantibodies.  These are rarely pathogenic and are most likely cross reactive, i.e. not specific toward an autoantigen.    >but to be clear you are saying it's not widely accepted vaccine adjuvants can cause the same autoantibody response in some people?  We don't tend to make antibodies against adjuvants.  Adjuvants are things such as aluminum.  To make an antibody against aluminum requires aluminum to be linked to a protein.  In this paper, they are trying to claim that the adenovirus is an ""adjuvant"" and that antibodies directed against the adenovirus are causing issues.  The adenovirus isn't an adjuvant in the system as it does not enhance the response against the spike protein.  It's a carrier to deliver genetic material.",COVID19,2024-08-24 14:35:42,True,,negative

gegmbeb,"Anti-vaxxers are a hated group, but they are human beings just like everyone else. They may not base their fears on science, (and they generally don't understand it), but they **do** trust _some_ people in their lives.   The problem is that they don't trust politicians and others ""in charge"", or government in general. They have a contrarian mindset, and follow the words of George Carling:   *_""I don't trust anything they government tells me!""_*   The reality is that over the past 100 years a lot of people in government have indeed done things that have caused this mistrust among a certain (and growing) part of the public. We can't blame it all on Facebook, even if this has allowed conspiracy theories to spread faster, like everyone else's.   **Here are two examples.**   First an old example, (there are many worse examples than this to be fair):   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods   Here is a more recent example of flip flopping and lying by Dr Fauci that has likely undermined his credibility with these people:   https://youtu.be/_2MmX2U2V3c   **So what to do?**   I think there is one way to get anti-vaxxers on board, which could be a huge win for the world, and for science as a whole, not just for this pandemic but for overall trust in the government when it comes to vaccinations.  **Here's what I propose:**   **1.** You invite a few selected ""prominent""/popular anti-vaxxers to one of the pharmaceutical companies for 1 day. Not Alex Jones level crazy, but people who the anti-vaxxers trust.  **2.** You have them go through all security screening, including Covid testing and suit them up with masks and suits.   **3.** You then let the anti-vaxxers randomly select 10 vials of vaccine, directly from the production line (with security detail and company representatives etc of course).   **4.** The anti-vaxxers have full control to follow those vials, in that they never leave their sight from the moment they pick them until they are used.   **5.** You have 10 prominent politicians proposed by the anti-vaxxers, including the UK Prime Minister arrive at the pharmaceutical company.   **6.** The politicians are then injected with the very vaccine vials that the anti-vaxxers have themselves selected from the production line and had control over during the day, from the moment they picked those vials until they were injected.  **7.** The entire thing is broadcast live as a ""stunt"" on TV/YouTube to show anti-vaxxers, (and others who are concerned) that even though we may not know _all_ the potential long-term side effects of the vaccine, the politicians are themselves willing to take the risk because it's worth it for us all.   **In my opinion something like this would be much more successful _by far_ than any information campaign they can put together, no matter how much money they spend on it.**   I know this is extreme, and many would say that we should just ""_force_ people to take it"", but anyone suggesting that haven't really thought through the consequences of such measures. Listen to this wise Member Of Parliament:  https://youtu.be/AsDGPOYuDkg   Trust of politicians and media in general is at an all time low, and this is not without reason. More and more people believe there is _one rule for them and another for us_.   This could help bring on board *a lot* of people to take the vaccine, who would likely otherwise be skeptical.   However, if there is a single ""hole"" in the process, whereby the vials could be switched over or the politicians could doubles, or it was edited footage etc the anti-vaxxers will find it, just as your post suggest.   It's a hard problem, but the way to go is not forced vaccinations, especially since 40% of UK health care workers, including doctors and nurses are themselves not sure they will take the vaccine.

The water outlet house needs that up and down slope for the pump to completely drain the water from the bottom of the dishwasher. If the water does not drain properly, the dirty water is not fully gone before the rinse cycle begins, which picks up the crap from the bottom and fouls the dishes while rinsing them, then once again the water is not gone before drying cycle begins and the moisture just never goes away.  I fought this for a few weeks when I installed mine. Took days of digging around the net to find this solution. Once I duct taped the outlet house under the top of the cabinet and got the slope correctly, the dishes come out sparkling clean and dry every time (I don't use the clear dry every time either)  I'm not a repairman, so I could be wrong, but as you keep removing your machine to drain it anyway, it may be worth a few minutes of tinkering.

I'll attach here my last post from early last night here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/mlqcm3/johnson\_and\_johnson\_this\_should\_be\_illegal\_lol/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/mlqcm3/johnson_and_johnson_this_should_be_illegal_lol/)

In short, got the J&J vaccine early yesterday morning and by mid-day I felt extremely tired, aches everywhere, headache, extremely high heart rate, & palpitations.

Back story: I'm 21, I'm a runner. I'm plant based. Never knew I had covid (explain in a minute). Overall really healthy..

Late last night I knew I had to go to the hospital because my heart was racing faster than when I run. I got to the hospital and I had a 101 fever, extremely high blood pressure, and a heart rate of 140ish. At one point my heart rate went up to 165. I kept feeling flip-flops in my chest which turned out to be PVC's & PAC's (These beats aren't dangerous, but very anxiety filling)

The doctor came in and told me ""Well you already had covid"" and I said ""What?"" and he said ""You're having an extreme immune response to this vaccine because you've had covid once before. You have every symptom of it. We have had tons of people come in with your exact symptoms"" And he said ""You actually have a really good immune system if you're acting like this. Let's give you fluids and an Ativan to call your heart rate down""

I had been exposed over 5 times to people who had covid and never caught it. A friend and I drove from Ohio to LA and 2 days later my friend tested positive for covid. He was sick, but I was not. I tested negative. I had been traveling Jan 2020 and had a slight cold after which I'm guessing was covid and just never knew..

Thought I'd share this story to help everybody and bring awareness as apparently this is happening a lot..

fwuqmy8,"> Sardinia is desperate for money to survive,  This is that logical fallacy that every place spews before they get an object lesson in what covid does to your economy if you don't stay closed.   Sardinia is only foolishly saying ""but we need tourism to survive"" right now because they ARENT in Northern Italy, and didn't live thru what Lombardy did. Notice that no place that suffered the brunt of a real outbreak tries to equate economic flourishing with survival, because they had actual death visit them.   You need to SURVIVE to survive. Sardinia only has people clamoring to visit right now because they don't have a reputation as a hot spot. They will give themselves that reputation if they flout measures in place to protect them.   Florida is fucked for tourism no matter whether they open up in defiance of sanity or whether they close. Because they are now a hot spot and so tourists will stay away. The only question is how many lives they want to sacrifice in futility pretending that tourism is a thing right now.   Sardinia is making the same dumb misunderstanding we have seen several times: thinking that they are picking ""covid OR economy"" - that is a false choice, the actual options are ""you can have no covid and no economy, or you can have TONS of covid and STILL no economy"".   They are fortunate that they have been lucky enough to continue to be so foolish.  And for god's sake, if it IS possible in some tiny parts of the world to have tourism in the time of COVID, the FASTEST way to throw it away is to bend the rules for upper class AMERICAN twits. And I say that as an American twit. That's like trying to save your economy by throwing seminars for Wuhan healthcare workers in January, buffet lunch included.  If i'm a rich prick from Monaco, the last thing I want to hear is that the vacation destination I'm eyeing will be teeming with wealthy Americans.

Masks take care of the large viral droplets very well. It does far less well when it comes to the fine viral droplets. Prior to COVID, there wasn't much data on how masks affect the transmission of viruses. The CDC made no formal recommendation when it came to viruses and masks outside of a healthcare setting.   In the past, the New York Times called them helpful but ""far from foolproof.""  https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/well/live/face-masks-work-healthy-colds-flu-immunity-prevention.html  >A century later, the advent of modern molecular techniques confirmed that surgical masks can indeed provide good protection against flu. In a 2013 study, researchers counted the number of virus particles in the air around patients with flu. They found that surgical masks decreased the exhalation of large viral droplets 25-fold. The masks were, however, less effective against the fine viral droplets that can remain suspended in the air longer and are therefore more infectious, cutting them by 2.8 times.  Further, studies that have confirmed their benefits are done in a healthcare setting and rely on perfect use.   >Unfortunately, most people fail to wear a mask faithfully enough to achieve this degree of protection, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention remains equivocal about the use of masks outside of health care settings. “No recommendation can be made at this time for mask use in the community by asymptomatic persons, including those at high risk for complications, to prevent exposure to influenza viruses,” the agency concludes on its website.

fpot52l,"It's hard to make later in life retirement investments grow by the time you need them  Someone in their mid 20s who can put money away can reasonably expect a roughly 4-fold return by the time they need to retire.  If you don't get that money put away until you are 50, you'll be lucky if you see a 40% gain by the time you retire.  Sure physicians can put a lot of money away, but it happens closer to retirement. Most physicians seem to delay retiring until later (which is a trend among all working professionals, I think).  I've talked to lawyers that bill $600 for an hour with a single client. A physician can make $2000 in a good 12 hour shift shift, while being responsible for 20-30 patients. I know consultants who bill their clients in the $400-500 range per hour.  I don't think physicians are being overpaid when you take this into account, compared to other professionals.

h1om4lt,"Which strain did you get vaccinated against?  I’m not sure about the vaccine efficacy against strains, look at this:  Calgary hospital has 22 cases linked to Delta COVID-19 variant, including 10 fully vaccinated  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theglobeandmail.com/amp/canada/alberta/article-covid-19-outbreak-at-calgary-hospital-linked-to-delta-variant-grows-to/  What Dr.Geert and the mRNA vaccines inventor predicted is currently happening:  Antibody-dependent enhancement. As predicted, the vaccinated are at greater risk because they are immune to the specific spike protein and not the whole virus. It's allowing new strains with enough variance to be a trojan horse and take hold worse than they otherwise would have. Rolling out a vaccine in the middle of a pandemic is just putting evolutionary pressure on the virus to evade the spike protein protection.

(the 2+% CFR doesnt apply for young people, ages 20-29 is more like 0.2% and of those, 80% have a preexisting medical condition --> 0.002*0.2 = 0.0004)  If we consider the fact that MANY people will get or have gotten this disease thinking it's a common cold or the flu - we should realize that these numbers are probalby highly inflated. My mathematically educated guess would be that i have a 0.1-0.2 chance of contracting a serious case of COVID within the coming weeks and a 0.00004% chance of dying.

flh9mcq,"I am conservative and have no sympathy for these senators, particularly Loeffler.   Her dumping of stock and the purchase of stock in a company that sells work from home software is particularly troubling. She pleads ignorance on Twitter, but her husband is the CEO of the New York Stock Exchange. I find it extremely suspicious when Loeffler says she didn't even know that stock got dumped at the perfect time. Net worth of a half billion and she has no say when her broker blindly sells 1.5 million dollars in stock from companies that would tank during a pandemic? Bullshit.   They all have the right to a fair trial should the Ethics Committee recommend prosecution.   My only question is if all their hearings on COVID-19 were open or closed to the public. I see a possible defense if the meetings were 100% open to the public.  If you were reasonably paying attention to the news, you would have seen the possible disaster looming if COVID-19 wasn't contained to one area in China.  Now, if they got closed door information,  I don't see a defense. If there isn't enough evidence to recommend charges, I hope the Senate censors all of them.   With Loeffler and her husband, they have a net worth of half a billion dollars.  The greed always amazes me. They could have taken the hit on the stocks they sold,  may have lost six figures.  I could see the purchase of the stock in the teleconference software being far easier to defend than the selling of the 1.5 million in stock.  But damn, how much is enough?    It makes one wonder how they accumulated the wealth they have. Insider trading is harder to detect. If some big investment firm has an algorithm scanning the internet for key words, or if they get the information  (like a company going bankrupt) a split second before anyone else, they can execute their trade before anyone has a chance to finish reading the title of the news story.  That is very hard to detect directly.  I'm being generous with getting the news a second before anyone else.  They could get it milliseconds before everyone else and execute their trades.  When Delta had their flash crash when an old story on Delta's bankruptcy decades ago hit the internet, I couldn't even log in to my brokerage account website.     Loeffler's history is sketchy from the start. Look at her and her husband and tell me why she married ber husband.   At a minimum,  the Republicans need to run someone else for Loeffler's current seat (she was appointed by the governor).",Reddit_Comment,2020-03-25 17:50:20,True,,negative

We don’t know their effectiveness in humans yet, but updated vaccines provided ~60% additional protection last fall.  This season is more complicated because there are two slightly different Covid-19 choices. There are pros and cons to each:  mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) are more up-to-date, targeting the latest Omicron subvariants, and are presumably more effective against infection (in the short term). Both manufacturers made a JN.1 vaccine but found that the KP.2 was better in inducing antibody responses against current variants. The Pfizer vaccine is probably better than Moderna for those at higher risk of myocarditis (i.e., younger men).  The traditional protein vaccine (Novavax) cannot be updated as quickly, so it had to go with the older subvariant version. Novavax’s data suggest that this is probably okay, as even this older variant version gave good responses against current variants. For some (including me!), the side effects of mRNA vaccines can be intense. I’ll be getting Novavax for this reason.  We don’t know if Novavax performs better (or worse) than mRNA vaccines.

Traditional vaccines use a weakened or inactive version of a virus, a modified version of a different virus, or a small subsection of the target virus to guide your immune system. mRNA vaccines are not any part of the virus itself, instead they tell your body to *make* a specific, harmless protein that is part of the virus that will then be turned around on and targeted by your immune system - in the case of covid, the spike protein. The advantages of mRNA vaccines are that they have no chance of a real infection *from the virus within the vaccine itself* (because there is none) in someone with a weakened immune system, are easier to reconfigure as a virus evolves, and able to be highly personalized.",COVID19,2024-03-10 17:20:28,True,,negative

nhwr99,"Theres alot of negative posts, worry and anxiety in this sub. Which is totally normal given the circumstances. I just wanted to stem the anxiety and serve a reminder and that the vast, vast majority of people have the vaccines with no long term repercussions. People will rarely come onto forum sites and post their positive experiences - they have the jab and forget about it. So remember that this sub isnt reflective of the wider vaccination programmes going on. Having some temporary side effects is way better in the long run than potentially dying from Covid. 

Personally, 30M. Had 1st dose of Astrazeneca in March and the 2nd dose today. I was naturally anxious about the whole blood clot news, but as of yesterday there have only been 15 cases out of 9 million doses second doses (Source: MHRA), which is incredibly reassuring. Circa 1 in 600,000! And Covid itself has an 8x higher chance of giving clots - I personally have a relative whos only 20 years old with no health conditions, who caught Covid and developed clots in his lungs. Lastly, I remind myself that vaccines are ultimately essential...as we cannot spend our lives locked inside forever.

Lying erodes public trust which can damage the efficacy of the overall system - see antivax as a symptom of it (yes, you can't solve the issue entirely ever but the point is to never push that envelope). It's also unethical for a medical practitioner to lie about the efficacy of the treatment. If he thought masks weren't useful he could say something like ""current research suggests X"" but the standards of modern medicine are to be very careful and lying even if you think it's for the greater good is unethical. Patient autonomy and the veracity of the information you give them are at the top of everything - they even come before treatment of the patients themselves. You might disagree with this but this is the current paradigm of modern medicine.  Also if diverting the supply chains necessitates 0 masks be delivered to the public, so be it. They have to make a conscious effort on how to allocate masks in this current scenario.

1nl3lu0,"Got my COVID booster yesterday (Thursday) after work. The arm pain didn't start at all for like 4-5 hours, which I thought was weird and slow. Middle of the night and next morning arm pain is pretty bad. I haven't really noticed other symptoms - usually I get pretty bad headaches. My dreams were vivid?

Anyway, I left the bandaid on and notice that it's really high on my arm. Not in the beefiest part of my muscle. Only about one finger below the acromion.

How worried about it's effectiveness would you be if you were me? 

I would prefer answers supported by evidence. I found standard nursing vacation IM administration guidelines, and those recommend at least two fingers below the acromion and above the armpit.

---
Update:
He knew exactly where it was: it was bleeding. I took the bandaid off this morning and there's a small bruise at the site.

Glad to hear effectiveness shouldn't be an issue. I was worried since my overall immune reaction seemed less than other COVID shots I've gotten.

Fortunately, he missed the shoulder capsule - I think/hope - though he got pretty damn close.

---

Second update, late Sunday:
Shoulder pain is basically non-existent. I went climbing yesterday with it and nothing bad happened.

So, end result: it was fine. He DID go high. That may have made it more painful than normal.
The vaccine-arm pain wasn't my concern: my concern was that it took so long to start and the lack of other symptoms. And it being objectively not where it was supposed to be.
Typically I'll feel arm pain for any shot within like an hour, lots of incentive to keep it moving.",Vaccine,2025-09-19 22:29:00,True,,negative

First of all, you’re original comment was talking about how ‘this is just the flu and we are acting like it’s the apocalypse.’ You are deliberately trying to twist your own words to make it seem like you have a case here.    Second of all, (in response to your original comment), the Coronavirus is much worse than the flu. The amount of people (in the US, since for some reason you can only get stats from there) who are hospitalised due to the flu is under 1% . In a study of 44672 cases, ‘13.8% (6,168 cases) severe and 4.7% (2,087) critical.’ I think that this percentage is enough to realise that this is not ‘simply the flu.’    If you look at deaths, the fatality rate for the flu is roughly 0.1%. Coronavirus? Studies show 1.4% to 2.3%. Despite the difference, that is a heck of a lot higher than the flu - 14 to 23 times the fatality rate.   It is not ‘simply another version of the flu’. It’s much, much worse, and you would be a fool not to treat it as such.

fl4qluz,"Reading the answers people gave me and also reading a bit more online I think I got some different insights. I also appreciate greatly that your answer has been so calm and genuinely argumentative.  It is very fair to assume that language gets its meaning from usage. Therefore, people from the USA have given the meaning of ""from the USA"" to the word ""American"". However, I also believe that language changes over time, precisely because of shifts in usage. In my case, I (Spanish) live in the Netherlands in a very international environment in which 95% of the people I know use English to talk between each other, this language being not our mother tongue. English has in many places become an international meaning-conveyor method. My environment is a clear example of that. Non-native English speakers have started to create a new language in which we try to express ourselves the best we can coming from our mother tongues. This is the case for the word American. Some people from countries from the Americas have found that the word they would use to describe themselves in their mother tongues, literally translated, does not represent them. They are trying to get some space in this new bent and blended English.  I see now how I was an ignorant to assume that the word American, as it is used in present days by native speakers, should include any person from the American continent. However, in my opinion, it is also ignorant the attitude of not accepting that language changes and specially that now almost the entire world is making an effort to learn English and use it and that this fact is going to imply some changes. At least ignorant to not even give a thought and neglect the fact that some changes could be made to make some people feel more included or accepted.

1gg7onx,"I have a 6-month-old son who was due for his shots. I asked the physician if the nurse could draw the vaccine in the office so I could confirm that the correct vaccine was given, along with checking the expiration date. The physician took it personally and told me that if I didn’t trust the office, then I should not be their patient. The nurse, on the other hand, didn’t have any problems with this request and showed me the vial. The reason I initially asked the doctor and not the nurse was because I would not see the nurse until she was ready to administer shots. 

I am an RN, but I left nursing a while ago. I was working on the ICU floor, but I would occasionally float to pediatrics, and there were times when parents requested that I show them what medications were administered or verify insulin dosage. I never had an issue with them and always complied with the request, understanding that there is a human factor and that errors, unfortunately, happen to the best of us. Doctor’s reaction made me very sad. I liked the doctor and didn’t want to disrespect him. I just wanted to confirm that the correct vaccine was given for my peace of mind. I have been very sad for a few days now, because I offended him and also because we will now have to change practice. But if I didn’t verify I would feel very anxious that correct vaccine was given.

fz1kmj1,"There a lot of things that factor in. What his comment is describing in regard to his girlfriend is not something the flu itself will cause. She likely developed an empyema (pus between your lung and chest wall) which is caused by bacterial infections. She likely developed that bacterial infection as a consequence of having a viral pneumonia. Staph aureus pneumonia while not common, it is the most frequent infection people who have serious influenza pneumonia develop and it has a high propensity to have a lot of complications like he described above. When it comes to dying from influenza and covid for that matter it’s really not always black and white, this seems to be the most misunderstood thing in the general population. It’s often the extra physiologic stress all your organ systems have to account for that causes people to crump. If you’re driving your car around with low and old oil, but you just coast and keep the rpms low it’ll probably do ok for awhile. But if you decide you wanna drag race someone that extra stress is going to cause something to fail. Comorbidites are the ‘old low oil’, covid and influenza are the drag race.

geg8t88,"Lots of people have given good responses to you, and I'll add one more thing--the main reason many timelines for vaccine development are longer than these ones were is because it usually takes a long time to get enough participants interested in a trial, and then it takes a really long time for enough infections to occur among trial participants to evaluate efficacy. Think about the Guardasil vaccine: doctors had to find enough parents willing to let their teenage children participate in a vaccine trial, and then they had to monitor those patients for years as they became old enough to be sexually active, and then wait until enough of them had contracted HPV. This took years.   With COVID, neither of these problems were present; there were tons of interested volunteers, and the disease is running so rampant that it only took a few months for the trials to hit the target number of total cases. The science behind the trials is exactly the same as it usually is; calling it ""rushed,"" as many people do, isn't accurate.

And in some ways, I think those parents do care, but they are elevating this fear over real wisdom and scientific evidence.   My sister's kids have had far more medical issues than either mine or my brother's, all of whom are fully vaccinated. You will have moments of fear no matter which way you go, but in today's landscape, with vaccines being demonized based on studies proven to be falsified or on manipulated data, your child catching some of these devastating illnesses is greater. And while kids do recover from things like measles, they are far more likely to have serious complications than from vaccines.  I finally determined that I had post-partum anxiety and sought help for that. I sought care for that and it helped. There is normal anxiety after becoming a parent, but if you feel that it is really impacting your life, you might consider finding a pro to talk to!  I know I can say all the things and the anxiety will still be there, if maybe less. I know that there will always be a tiny bit of doubt. Its normal with big decisions like this. But it will be there either way.  I am in fear every day for my sister's kids. Every time they get sick (which is basically all winter even tho they homeschool), I am afraid.

Most often (at least in my industry) is who, what, when and where. And it shouldn't take long to answer.   Colours are good, but if you use them poorly, they may cloud the answers. Clear colours for certain variables make a world of difference. Clear charts also help with this.   A mixture of charts and tables is always nice. Certain people need the visual, others need the numbers. Management needs the trends and high level figures. Sometimes you need to split things up for different crowds.   Don't try and make things over complicated. Your job is to simplify things for users so they can action on things. This also means you need to understand the data and what your dashboard or report is going to be used for. That means knowing your audience. Also, build the must haves first, nice to have and ""cool"" stuff can come in later releases.  And last but not least. This world is a mixture of science and art.

This was the 1st place we found at $500 dollars OVER that budget per month, that wasn't rented out from underneath us because so many people were looking for rentals. Housing crises exist all over this country. I had always heard about it but we had never struggled with it because we are debt free and our income is sufficient for what we need. But it was very different when we came here. We couldn't find anything, so we continued to expand the radius of our search. We even looked at buying, but we needed something we could sell in 2-4 years because we are military, which even further limited those options. This all went on for months. So when this house became available, we took it. I checked out all the utilities except internet to make sure we had access. But after 8 days notice to move here, and 6 months in an RV I overlooked the internet checkbox, I fully own that mistake. This was necessatiy, and our only choice, so honestly, I'm not sure I wouldn't have rented this place even without internet access, because we needed somewhere to live.   So please don't judge everyone. Just because your statements may be true for a mass majority, doesnt mean it is true for everyone. Kindness and respect still go a long ways. Through this process I learned how many people don't have access.  I never would have known otherwise.   We make it work. And our kids are adjusted, like awesome military kids. We play games and interact as a family instead if streaming constantly. The way I used to when I was a kid. We watch actual dvds. Do we miss instant access? Sure. But we also go to the library, and talk to neighbors, something we  neglected a little more when we were at our last base in the middle of a city, where the neighbors didn't have half acre to acre plots, and weren't as kind and friendly.  At our next base it'll be a different struggle. But I'll remember to check internet. I never make the same mistake twice. But with the new mistake, I'll learn something new, and we will adjust. As always. Life is positive, and fun  and an adventure.  I'm not claiming to have an answer to the problem with infrastructure. I'm not sure what would incentivize ISP companies that, in the end, wouldn't come out of taxpayer's pockets. And I agree that companies usually put money over people. I'm not saying we should turn into a government mandated country like China. I was only bringing awareness to some facts. I didn't have this awareness before I moved here.

fn4g17g,"Now that we have passed 20k deaths from covid 19, i think its important to go back and note the comparisons that were made between covid 19 and influenza.   According to CDC estimates, 2018-2019 season(which to my understanding is around november to February), there were around 34,000-57,000 deaths. It is an estimate because it's hard to know exactly the cause of death of some patients and some don't even go reported I guess. Now, the covid 19 death count to my understanding is only from about the last 4-5 weeks. So you can see it really catching up to the flu numbers and also that it has increased in a much shorter time frame. For those who want to question the ""estimated"" part of the data, remember that covid 19 deaths are also an estimation for pretty much the same reasons.   Now I'm not one of the super panickers and I'm definitely not just nonchalant about this crisis. I tell my friends and family how important the shelter in place is and I've been doing the same. At the root of it all, prevention is the best way to prevent getting sick/passing it on to others. I know that there are still groups not adhering to shelter in place and gathering for weddings, parties, hanging out in parks and whathaveyou. And it sucks that the govt is trying to enforce. But the quickest way to get out of the house back to normal is to not get sick, not get others sick, help others not get sick. I don't want this shelter in place/quarentine/travel restrictions/layoffs/etcetc any longer than it has to. But the fact that although we all have the right to be outdoors and live our lives, we don't have the right to knowingly put others at risk. You want to argue that getting on the road can lead to potential accident and dear, to that I say well no one knows that they will get into an accident and kill someone. We know that being around people can get them sick/us sick. It's still not too different from preventing colds and flu.

For last week's paycheck Wednesday-Sunday I clocked in 50 hours which is the first time we've ever been allowed to use overtime. Every day I was called in early and stayed late. I was working 10-12 hour shifts every day. The latest I stayed was 130am one night when the store closes at 10.  And I did all this for minimum wage salary knowing id be at extreme risk of getting sick especially because I haven't been sleeping much and a large portion of my shift was pushing carts outside in the rain so my immune system must be low right now. But thankfully I don't feel sick at all.  The first few days the store was incredibly busy. There were lines to get in the store when we open. The line at the cashier reached all the way to the back wall and started looping around. It was busier than Christmas week or Grand Opening. However the last couple days now that we're completely out of sanitizer, toilet paper, water, beans, rice, meat, onions, potatoes, bread, eggs, milk etc the traffic has died down to where it's extremely slow simply because we don't have much to sell. Some departments are going home early because they have 0 backstock. Today is my one day off so I'm not sure what it's like today but unless we get some significant stock I think they're going to cut hours or something soon.   Whenever we do get something it's sold out within minutes though. I remember we got a shipment of rice and beans and the crowd gathered around them and started fighting so we had to barricade the section off and have employees guard it only letting one person near them at a time.

Then, almost over night, the attitude changed and then as things start to open back up they become mandatory.  Had health professionals and the government been more consistent in their message and advocate for citizens to wear cloth masks early on and been up front with how much they do help instead of saying that they do absolutely nothing then I think some Americans would be more keen to wearing them.   I even think if companies and the government would say things like “we recommend masks” or “we encourage masks” or “masks have been proven to keep yourself and others well” would go better than the government stepping forward and saying “masks are mandatory” especially now when a good portion of American cities are currently pushing back against law makers and law enforcement and are not looking to comply with those that they are protesting against.

I could really use some advice.

I (23F) got my **first dose of Gardasil 9 on May 15**. I was planning to get my **second dose on July 15** and the **third dose on November 15**, but honestly, I’m not sure if I can afford all 3 doses right now since in my country we have to pay for the HPV vaccine ourselves.

I’ve seen different recommendations from health authorities about 1, 2, or 3-dose schedules, and it’s confusing. I’ve read that WHO and some studies say a single dose can be effective, while other guidelines still recommend 3 doses, especially for older age groups.

Given that I’m 23 and started the vaccine at this age:

* Is **1 dose enough** for me?
* Would **2 doses be protective**, or is it not sufficient at my age?
* Do I really need all **3 doses** to get proper protection?

I really want to protect myself against HPV, but the financial side is tough. Any insights from people who’ve been in a similar situation, or any healthcare professionals here, would be so appreciated.

The key is to go over it with yourself or someone else, talk her through. Remind her that she's getting adequate amounts of oxygen, she's not breathing in her own CO2, it's just humidity from her breath and it's all going to be ok. Deep breaths in and out through the mouth since the metal clip can pinch the nose, nice and easy.   Understandably, it's far easier said than done but it works.

lprmufk,I don't watch any television programming for over a decade now. I don't consume mainstream media at all so the propaganda barely reaches my ears. I will do the exact opposite when and if the government recommends something especially if it's health related.   When they were recommending COVID patients be put on ventilators it turns out that was the wrong thing to do and the ventilators were what caused that person to die not COVID. And masks did nothing to stop the spread along with the vaccine it didn't stop you from catching COVID or spreading it. It was lie after lie and all of these things have been proven but you won't look into it yourself you just believe what some corporation on tv tells you to believe or you get your info from main stream sources that are compromised and will never give you the truth about anything. Because it's easier to control the masses when they can't think for themselves and critical thinking has gone out the window. You should research who Edward Bernays is and what he did as a job for the government. They call it public relations today but back in the early 1900s it was called propaganda.

hbk9v3i,"You just repeated exactly what I said, people who are vaccinated are less likely to get severe illness and hospitalisation. So you’re argument is still useless since the pandemic will not come to an end if like you say “every able bodied person needs to get vaccinated, wear a mask and distance” for a pandemic to come to an end herd immunity needs to happen and that can not happen if we can not prevent the spread of the virus and like you yourself say the vaccine does not prevent someone from spreading the disease. On top of that you say that all people who are severely ill are people who have not been vaccinated because they haven’t chosen to not get vaccinated, why in the world do you care if someone who has chosen to take the risk to die - dies? You want other people to take the vaccine because you need to justify your willingness to follow blindly the propaganda you have been fed. You need to tell yourself that you’re taking the vaccine for the greater good of the population and you need to tell yourself that you’re saving other people’s lives by taking the vaccine - news flash, people who have chosen to not take the vaccine don’t want you to save them. And the other half of the people who have taken the vaccine they also don’t need to be saved because they believe the vaccine saved them. So I’m not really sure who you’re trying to save here because it’s isn’t yourself is it?   Also the fact that you think people would willingly get a vaccine that is still in trial until 2023 is beyond me. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04516746",CovidVaccine,2021-09-04 12:46:19,True,,negative

lnnfrdp,"""ABSTRACT  # Objective  Assessment of COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy using population-based data.  # Design  Matched case–control study nested in a retrospective cohort.  # Setting  April 2021–March 2022, England.  # Population or Sample  All pregnant individuals aged between 18 and 50 years with valid health records.  # Methods  Individuals identified from the national Maternity Services Data Set (MSDS) had their records linked to hospital admission, national COVID-19 vaccine and COVID-19 testing databases. Matching included participant's age and estimated week of conception. We compared outcomes across multiple COVID-19 vaccine exposures using conditional multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for demographic and health characteristics.  # Main Outcome Measures  Adverse pregnancy, maternal and neonatal outcomes.  # Results  514 013 individuals were included. We found lower odds of giving birth to a baby who was low birthweight (aOR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.79–0.93), preterm (aOR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.85–0.92) or who had an Apgar score < 7 at 5 min of age (aOR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80–0.98) for individuals who received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. The odds of admission to intensive care unit during pregnancy were lower in those vaccinated (aOR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.76–0.95). There was no association between vaccination in pregnancy and stillbirth, neonatal death, perinatal death and maternal venous thromboembolism in pregnancy.  # Conclusions  COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy. Our findings generated important information to communicate to pregnant individuals and health professionals to support COVID-19 maternal vaccination programmes.""",COVID19,2024-09-17 23:13:14,True,,negative

I believe the CDC has tried its best to keep is informed and to be as truthful as possible, but they are still figuring things out.   “Long-Term Effects Updated Nov. 10, 2020 CDC is actively working to learn more about the whole range of short- and long-term health effects associated with COVID-19. As the pandemic unfolds, we are learning that many organs besides the lungs are affected by COVID-19 and there are many ways the infection can affect someone’s health.  While most persons with COVID-19 recover and return to normal health, some patients can have symptoms that can last for weeks or even months after recovery from acute illness. Even people who are not hospitalized and who have mild illness can experience persistent or late symptoms. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate. CDC continues to work to identify how common these symptoms are, who is most likely to get them, and whether these symptoms eventually resolve.  The most commonly reported long-term symptoms include:  Fatigue Shortness of breath Cough Joint pain Chest pain Other reported long-term symptoms include:  Difficulty with thinking and concentration (sometimes referred to as “brain fog”) Depression Muscle pain Headache Intermittent fever Fast-beating or pounding heart (also known as heart palpitations) More serious long-term complications appear to be less common but have been reported. These have been noted to affect different organ systems in the body. These include:  Cardiovascular: inflammation of the heart muscle Respiratory: lung function abnormalities Renal: acute kidney injury Dermatologic: rash, hair loss Neurological: smell and taste problems, sleep issues, difficulty with concentration, memory problems Psychiatric: depression, anxiety, changes in mood The long-term significance of these effects is not yet known. CDC will continue active investigation and provide updates as new data emerge, which can inform COVID-19 clinical care as well as the public health response to COVID-19.  Preventing COVID-19 The best way to prevent these long-term complications is to prevent COVID-19. The best strategies for preventing COVID-19 infection in youth and adults are to wear a mask in public places, stay at least 6 feet away from other people, frequently wash your hands, and avoid crowds and confined or poorly ventilated spaces.”   It does tell you that MOST persons will recover just fine.

The risk of any severe side effect from these vaccines is so small compared the the risk of having serious issues from covid. Personally, I chose to get Pfizer.  All 3 are new technology, none has the traditional dead or weak virus in it which is what I'd prefer but it's not an option in our country but these new ones are more effective.  I chose Pfizer because they actually make drugs and vaccines unlike Moderna and it has less active ingredient so the chance of typical side effects is lower.  J&J is more stable but in doing so, it has near the traditional load of chemicals in it to help preserve it so that one was out for me.  The mRNA ones actually have so little ingredients in them that it's fairly impressive, just mRNA and 4 different lipid particles diluted ed into saline.  But the downside is its two vaccines, it takes longer to work, and you will likely have side effects twice.

Fast forward I went months without it happening.. and a few months ago (after having Covid in June) it started to happen again randomly. Again, only seem to happen with white white and not every time I have 3 kids and I like my nightly glass or two of wine let’s be honest.

Fast forward to two weeks ago I got my flu shot and had a glass of red wine the same red I always drink (and again it never happened with red) .. now it just randomly happens. Last night had a few glasses while watching a movie and fine .. tonight one sip and my face lit up like a firework..

fk5htm0,"I don't believe your statement is correct.  This site lists global diseases this Century:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_epidemics  Out of that list of 66 epidemics only 5 have killed more people than Covid-19.  So far so good for your claim. However let's list them:  1) Cholera: 2008-2009. Zimbabwe. Killed 4293.  Localized to Zimbabwe. Not a global threat.  2) Cholera: 2017. Haiti. Killed 9985.  Localized to Haiti. Not a global threat.  3) measles: 2011 - present. Killed > 4500. Localized to DRC. Not a global threat.   4) Ebola: 2013 - 2016. Killed 11,300. Much slower to transmit than Covid-19. Twice as many deaths but over 3 years. Covid-19 has nearly half that death count in just 3 months.  5) Swine flu (influenza): 2009. Killed 203,000 worldwide. Clearly far more people died than have with Covid-19 yet that was over an 18 month period and final case fatality rate is 0.01 - 0.08. That's 43 to 350 times less fatal than Covid-19 has shown so far. Should Covid-19 spread to the same extent it would kill 8.7 - 71 million people, far surpassing Swine Flu.  If you have any other knowledge of other more dangerous diseases then please present them here to qualify your statement.  I only present this information because whilst people shouldn't panic,  putting out incorrect comments that cause people to lower their guard will only serve to increase how deadly Covid-19 becomes.

They’re starting to go up fast, and hospitalizations which lag cases but come before deaths are now tracking with cases in terms of breaking records daily now.  I hope one day the people saying this realize just how wrong they were, though hopefully it doesn’t take losing someone they know for that to happen.

h7bxbaz,"My youngest aunt died of the coronavirus 2 weeks before her age bracket was allowed to get the vaccine in Ohio.   She was 57 year old and the 40-65y/o people were after the 65+ group. She wanted the vaccine too but for a couple months couldn't get it because she was just ""too young"" at nearly 60.   She died suddenly the middle of the night due to one of the known complications...blood clots causing a heart attack. She didn't have any preexisting conditions that make COVID-19 worse. Just like many people, it just hit her especially hard. It's like playing Russian roulette with this virus.  If she had gotten just one dose before she got infected, she'd probably still be alive. Also, if the governor of Ohio took the trump-shaped stick out of his ass, he would not have lifted the state-wide mask mandate before reaching a 70%+ vaccination rate, which likely led to even more infections.  And I hear all these dumb fucks who are able to get a vaccine and have *easy access* to the vaccine...but won't get the vaccine and instead *brag* about refusing the vaccine. It's those same assholes who refuse to wear a mask or stay home if they feel sick that likely infected my aunt. She left behind two kids and two young grand kids.  So, my compassion for people who still are unwilling to vaccinate is pretty much null at this point. I hear stories on the news all the time how people in the hospital, on deaths door, now want to get the vaccine. I fail to give a crap that it took getting hospitalized for them to take it seriously. It's not like it's a fucking mystery that COVID-19 is deadly or causes terrible health effects...we've seen images of crazy full ICUs and heard horror stories from crying doctors and people in our own communities for the past year.

After I got the vaccine, I’m suddenly getting sick constantly. About once a month, sometimes twice. Not just light sore throat or a headache. I’m getting everything possible. Swollen lymph nodes, strep throat every few months, bile stomach flus, extreme pharyngitis, sore throats so bad I can’t even swallow water, in need of antibiotics every few months.

Does the Novavax vaccine offer superior efficacy?  **Longer-lasting protection:**  >A primary series of NVX-CoV2373 induced persistent immune responses up to 1 year after the second dose. The vaccine was well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile. We believe our findings offer important insights for determining dosing intervals between primary and booster vaccinations.  * [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X24000689](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X24000689)  **The breadth of protective antibodies (against additional and future variants) actually increases with additional shots:**  >These data indicate that boosting with the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine resulted in enhanced cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 variants, a decreased gap between immune recognition of the variants and the ancestral strain, and the induction of a potentially more universal-like response against SARS-CoV-2 variants. We believe that this phenomenon may be driven by the conserved epitopes found on the recombinant protein vaccine, whereby expression of the full-length trimers of the S protein present epitopes that are conserved across variants for recognition by the immune system.[^(4)](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2215509#core-r4) This process may be further enhanced by the saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant by means of epitope spreading.[^(5)](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2215509#core-r5)  * [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2215509](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2215509)  **Better protection in the upper respiratory tract:**  >One of the important findings of our study is that NVX vaccines blunt virus replication in the upper respiratory airway early post-infection.... the mRNA-1273 booster offered only limited protection early post-infection (at Days 2 and 4) in the upper airways.

h7bj6hs,"No, new cases and spread of CoV2 is not the same as death.  Vaccinated people can still catch CoV2 and spread it.  However, a negative outcome (as in death) is not likely.  Here's my personal take: - 2020 I switched to a diet recommended by doctors and the NIH (mostly plant-based and almost no meat).  I ate meat 3 meals a day for 30+ years prior.  I occasionally eat meat as a treat but it is rare. - Unvaccinated I wore a mask to prevent myself catching and spreading CoV2. - Vaccinated in March/April 2021; I have never stopped wearing a mask because I knew the possibility to catch and spread CoV2 was not 0%. - So far my conservative health stance means I don't endanger myself or my family.  I don't feel any pain wearing a mask and it doesn't bother me.  TL;DR   1. let's say you're conservative with health and get a vaccine  (with the potential for side effects; mine were minor) and wear a mask but never catch CoV2.  No harm.  Near 0% chance of death at this point in time even if you catch it. 2. Let's say you take a chance; don't get vaccinated and have a small chance of dying.

h7bv5k3,Worst part is that all these new variants are coming from the bodies of unvaccinated people who go into critical care.  Allowing them to live on a ventilator just gives the virus a perfect environment to mutate endlessly.    I listened to a [podcast](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/dispatch-14-covid-crystal-ball) where a man in the UK who was sick with covid for weeks was given the vaccine.  The problem was he already had like 10 different mutations of covid that were created in his body while he was sick.  When they gave him the vaccine the other mutations quickly took over and killed him.  What’s really crazy is they sequenced the strains in his body and found he had independently created the same variants found in other parts of the world before they became wide spread.    The fact we have the same strains mutating independently in different people in different parts of the world scares the shit out of me.  Just fuck these selfish awful people who won’t get vaccinated and stop this pandemic.,Reddit_Comment,2021-08-01 16:36:48,True,,negative

g7how31,> I'm struggling a bit to understand why this country is behaving in the current way    I think the behavior you see is mostly the result of downplaying of the Coronavirus by the RIVM (Dutch version of the CDC).

1nnsm55,"Hello All,

I'm back back back again, as they say. Anyway, the last time I posted here people were really helpful so I'm back. It was on the early side, but I got my flu shot in mid-august because of flying travel that I had to do and also in general working with children.

My next question - I have an acupuncture appointment tomorrow. My acupuncturist has said to wait until Wednesday or Thursday for the Covid shot (I plan to get Moderna as I have always gotten it), so at least 24 hours. I am scheduled to take a flight very early on Sunday morning, and returning not quite as ridiculously early Monday morning (2 and a half hours each way).

My question: I know the vaccine won't take effect before my flight, but, is it better to have gotten it before that Sunday flight, or is it too close before and it is just going to stress the immune system (which flying also does) so I should wait until I return?

Also if anyone has any experience with acupuncture and if waiting more than the 24 hour minimum is advisable, I'm definitely open to hear things.

You're already more vulnerable - something I share, and it has been life-threatening - and there's not really any reason *not* to get another dose of MMR.

s9xqmu,"Hi, I am 22 years old female with normal health.  Never had covid (or don't know about it).

First dose (May 2021), moderna: severe arm pain, headache the next day. Arm stopped hurting after 2 or 3 days.

Second dose (June 2021), moderna: immediately after the vaccination everything was normal, but at midnight (about 6 hours passed) I woke up with chills. I took paracetamol and was able to sleep. The next day was unpleasant. My temperature rose above 40° c (104 f), and I had a headache. The paracetamol helped, but not for long. The next day I woke up in a puddle of my own sweat, and after that I felt fine. Even went out for a walk.

I was afraid to do the booster, but a week ago I decided to do it anyway.
Booster (Jan 15, 2022), pfizer: I felt drowsy for a while after the shot, but that went away. The pain in my arm was not very severe and went away after 2 days. For another 3 days or so my body temperature was a little high (up to 37.5°c / 99.5 f) but it was not much of a problem, I took paracetamol a few times. And that was it. Now, a week after the shot, I feel completely normal.",Vaccine,2022-01-22 17:15:41,True,,negative

I know it is ranty and I am posting mainly regarding the virus and health protacols i just like to give detail, i apologize, its just i'm constantly told ""this is just how it is"" or such loads of crap.  I work in a town that consists of a large elderly retirement community complex, multiple smaller ones, and middle class/rich people, however the store i work at is independently owned so there is no corporate or HR departments and it is also a monopoly for the area as the nearest grocery store is about 20 minutes away in a town no one wants to travel to or cannot travel to, so as expected his prices are generally unfair, the product is often bad, beaten to a pulp or put on discount months after expiration date hits.  Thankfully we have a good supply of gloves, however there are no masks provided or hand sanitizer, someone stole the tiny little bottle for customers in one of our departments already and when i say no one is getting any i mean no one, cashiers had a few tiny bottles they could scrounge up from home and that is it  I wore a mask I had gotten, just a basic blue/white mask and all i got told all day by so many people, coworkers and customers alike, ""that doesn't work you know!"" and a few ignorant, racist remarks about china making the masks. I read that it doesn't help not getting infected, but it helps not spreading it so I just wanted to be responsible about this since i work with food all day, but this is the reception i get for trying to be safe.  Cashiers and Stocking aren't asked or made to wear gloves, cashiers are touching peoples fruits and veggies with their bare hands and again without any sanitizer for themselves to use.  The owner also is doing what I knew he was going to do and this is what i was told he said, ""let people buy what they want"", you don't have to think for a split second how that went for us.  No people limit either, packed to the brim, old people, children, disabled. I know other stores are doing hours just for the elderly and vulnerable, that conversation isn't even a whisper in the head here.  I'm worried about getting it myself, i'm young and in pretty good health, but that doesn't mean i shouldn't be afraid too. If I could even get N95s I was told it might be better not to wear it out anyways with people being insane and hoarding things, its a good point, but i HAVE to go to this job so I should have proper masks too.

They wouldn’t point out that a portion of the unnamed audience was also not wearing masks.  Edit to add: I’m not a liberal die-hard. I think every candidate has a few things that I support. I’m just against the two-party system. It’s too easy for the candidates, the media, and the over-excited voter (as I sometimes am) to paint a picture that’s black or white. I think the best course of action is to analyze *why* each party uses the information they have and *when* they use it.

Depending on the situation both are useful.  The problem might be that the antibody tests also lag, until your immune system has started to produce enough antibodies, you'll test negative.

fpopaey,"I've been on IBR for the past 8 years now. I'm aware of the PAYE plan that became available more recently and it would lower my payment by about 500 per month, but it will start the clock on my loan over if I consolidated and switch loan repayment plans and I'm not about to discard the last 8 years of payments for that. I'm an audiologist which means I have a specialized clinical doctorate like dentists and physical therapists have, and there is no master's option. It's all or nothing to the tune of about 160k for the four year program/residency. Each loan I took out for grad school had an interest rates of 6.5-7.5% and federal loans can only be consolidated to the average of your rates, which is why I haven't done that. When I started my career and was living on my own, my payments were about 850/mo. As I started to make more money and grow my patient population, I was owing around 1300/mo. I got married in 2018 and made the mistake of filing jointly so my husband's income bumped my payment to 2200/mo this year, but I called and had it reduces because I just had a baby 3 weeks ago and they allow for a 400 deduction for a new child not yet claimed with taxes. So yea... I'm fucked. I make about 130k per year and with taxes, a mortgage, insurance and everything (and we split it all in half)... I only manage to save about 800/mo but with a salary like mine and the amount of hard work I put in daily for my career, I would be doing a lot more with my property or I would be doing more with my free time if I didn't have this insurmountable loan on my back.

As for the covid vaccine I want more information to be released and only time will truly tell us all the side effects if studied properly. I don't trust it or what the governments narrative is (for me it's the Canadian government).   Trust your gut, if you don't want the vaccine and are anxious about it, don't get it. You have every right to be anxious btw. More and more countries, more and more people are seeing the vaccines as irrelevant or dangerous. A lot of European countries are seeing it as dangerous.   Australia just passed a medical (not sure if it's an act) that organ transplant patients for heart, lung and kidneys have to be double vaccinated.  Isreal has a high vaccination rate and high covid numbers. Showing how stupid this is. The ""vaccine"" has been presented as something it's not.  I honestly believe, had I thought about it a second longer and weighed everything, I wouldn't get it. I wish I didn't. It isn't worth it, to be able to let back into normal society activities. When the whole idea of excluding people from society that way, or medical treatment is horribly fucked. The way for this to end this, is to point it out and not follow their horrible disgusting rules. Italy has been fighting their mandates the entire time. I believe we should be doing the same. Then hopefully housing can go back to normal, being allowed to go to the movie theatre or restaurants, seeing family members who live abroad. All things we should be allowed to do. I can't leave Canada unless I'm double vaxed. Meaning I wouldn't be able to see my partners family who live in another country.   I recommend, finding another rental that doesn't have that as a requirement. Join a Facebook group that hopefully has your same ideas. There are more people who aren't vaccinated than you think. Don't trust the mainstream media information because they are following the trend of pressing vaccines on people for mass vaccination and follow government narratives.

g7fgfvx,"Your comments brings [this post](https://www.charlottedems.com/no-joy-in-the-white-house/) to mind:   By Elayne Griffin Baker  There’s no literature or poetry in the White House. No music. No Kennedy Center award celebrations. There are no pets in this White House. No loyal man’s best friend. No Socks the family cat. No kids’ science fairs. No times when this president takes off his blue suit-red tie uniform and becomes human, except when he puts on his white shirt-khaki pants uniform and hides from Americans to play golf. There are no images of the first family enjoying themselves together in a moment of relaxation. No Obamas on the beach in Hawaii moments, or Bushes fishing in Kennebunkport, no Reagans on horseback, no Kennedys playing touch football on the Cape.  I was thinking the other day of the summer when George H couldn’t catch a fish and all the grandkids made signs and counted the fish-less days. And somehow, even if you didn’t even like GHB, you got caught up in the joy of a family that loved each other and had fun. Where did that country go? Where did all of the fun and joy and expressions of love and happiness go?  We used to be a country that did the ice bucket challenge and raised millions for charity. We used to have a president that calmed and soothed the nation instead dividing it. And a First Lady that planted a garden instead of ripping one out. We are rudderless and joyless. We have lost the cultural aspects of society that make America great. We have lost our mojo, our fun, our happiness. The cheering on of others. Gone. The shared experiences of humanity that makes it all worth it. Gone. The challenges AND the triumphs that we shared and celebrated. The unique can-do spirit Americans have always been known for.

1i7kshs,"I was given the MMR series as a child and now as a 40-something year-old I work in healthcare. A few years ago I had an employer change and they wanted titers which had never been done for me. The titers found I was immune to mumps and rubella, but showed no immunity for measles. My physician gave me a measles booster, and the titer was repeated about eight weeks later. It was still negative. At that point, my PCP was involved and prescribed one more booster and told me that even if the next titer was negative, I was probably immune. Titer still came back negative. My concern is with the measles cases occurring courtesy of non-vaccinated people, I’m worried I could contract measles if I had to take care of a measles patient. It makes me wonder if I need to tell my employer about my lack of immunity, so I can opt out of taking those patients, but I’m concerned that they could fire me because I can’t take care of all patients. Has anyone had an experience or heard of an experience like this and how it went? The original employer who had the titer done was not concerned, but I’m with a different employer now who I don’t believe is aware of this.",Vaccine,2025-01-23 05:17:08,True,,negative

fposrte,"I agree with this statement. The number of residency positions funded by the government was lobbied to be kept at a certain (low) level, as residencies are used across the board to control the supply of physicians. For a foreign physician to practice in the US they have to also go through one of those limited residency positions.   I think there is a lot of room for reform across the board within our healthcare system, and one of those might be increasing the supply of qualified physicians. Obviously as supply increases salaries may decrease, but with changes like a drastic reduction in education costs, and setting reasonable starting salaries for residents it would put physicians along the same lines as other highly trained professional careers in terms of compensation.  Making more use of Nurse Practitioners and an increase in physicians would allow for a more reasonable ratio of patients to physicians. Increasing the number of personal, streamlining some of the bureaucracy by updating internal systems and procedures, and focusing on preventative care (through a more reasonable patient provider ratio) will lead to better healthcare results, less overworked physicians, and reductions in total healthcare expenditures.",Reddit_Comment,2020-05-06 18:33:52,False,,negative

fpjv2zc,"I used to work for tech support for a cable company.  One day, I had to help a woman whose internet had stopped working.  Generally, our first suggestion was to unplug the ethernet cable and plug it back in.  This resets the connection, and would often fix the issue.  If that didn't work, then we would move on to troubleshooting.  But due to policy, I was not allowed to move on to that until after the customer verifies that they have unplugged the cable, plugged it back in, and still has no internet.  So I pick up the call, and the woman (let's call her Shirley) politely informs me that her internet was working last night, but this morning she was getting the error that tells you you are offline. She's audibly annoyed, but is being nice and not acting like it's my fault, which was a welcome relief.    Me:  ""Okay, this can happen because of several different things.  Let's start with the simplest option first.  Are you familiar with what an ethernet cable looks like? There should be one plugged into the back of your computer.""  Shirley: ""Is it the one that looks like a phone wire?""  Me (slightly surprised that she actually knew what it was): ""Yes, the tip looks just like a phone wire, but a bit wider.  That wire is what carries all the data from the internet to your computer.  What I want you to do first is just unplug it for a few seconds, then plug it back in.""  Shirley: ""Oh, it isn't that.  The wire is plugged in right, I know because I was using the internet last night.""  Me: ""I'm sure it is.  They only fit in the space one way.  But unplugging and reconnecting it often solves the issue, before we have to move on to more complicated things.""  Shirley: ""But it CAN'T be that.  The wire hasn't been touched since the computer was first set up.  If the wire were the problem, we wouldn't have had internet this whole time.""  REMINDER: She is still using a friendly tone of voice and doesn't seem upset with me.  She just genuinely doesn't think the wire can be the problem  Me: ""Again, I dont think the cable wasn't properly plugged in.  But unplugging it and reconnecting it will reset the connection.  We have to try that before we start troubleshooting.""  Shirley: (now sounding slightly more annoyed) ""Look, I know it isn't the cable.  I don't want to crawl behind this dirty desk to unplug a cable I know is plugged in right.  So can we just move on and start troubleshooting?""  Now I'm annoyed and just want to get through this call.  Me: ""Ok, but the next option also requires unplugging the cable.  What often happens is that bad data can get stuck in your cable.  If you unplug the cable and shake it out, the bad data will be eliminated, allowing the connection to work again.""  AND SHE ACTUALLY DID IT.  She (grudgingly) unplugged the cable, and then stood there, shaking it out in a spectacle I only wish I could have seen.  Then she plugged it back in, and lo and behold, the internet worked again.  She thanked me profusely, also adding in the bit about ""See? If I had unplugged it and just plugged it back in like you said first, then I would have had to do it a second time to shake the bad data out."" I simply agreed, wished her well, and hung up.  Fast forward to the next day.  My boss calls me in to talk to him and tells me that he recieved a call from a very grateful woman, praising the awesome advice I had given her to ""shake out the bad data"" and that he wanted to know if I had actually told someone that.  I admitted that yes,  I did, but only because it was the only way I could get her to unplug the cable.

I have heard talks about them looking at better ways to distribute the money when they come of age and also classes on how to be responsible with their money.

mm42s7i,"You are probably fine. The CDC says that vaccinated adults may lose their titers, but that doesn't mean they lost immunity. Immunity means that you have memory cells that can produce antibody rapidly when challenged; it doesn't mean that you go around with high (or even detectable) titers all the time.   Studies have shown that [something like 50-60% of people](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10768653/) have ""non-immune"" titers for measles, 10 or 20 years after their vaccine. But if that meant no immunity, then we would be seeing a lot more adult measles in Texas right now, and we're not.   << Note at that link, the wide discrepancy of results, depending on whether you're doing a ELISA or a CLIA test.   Your doc will probably tell you to get another booster, since you're planning a pregnancy. If you check a titer 3 weeks after the booster---not necessary, but just out of curiosity---it'll probably be off the charts, but then it will wane as long as you are not exposed/ challenged by measles.   The standard for what we call ""immune"" and ""non-immune"" was set back in the 70s or 80s, I think, when people who had been vaccinated were probably exposed to measles more often, so they got the titers boosted up by those challenges. So it's postulated that people in the 1980s tended to run higher titers, but epidemiologic studies show that 95+% of adults are still protected by their vaccines from years ago.",VACCINES,2025-04-08 22:15:39,True,,negative

If we blame people, then there will be no systemic changes to social media, and as the system is set up it mostly functions as a weapon, because the logic of social media as it is is virality, engagement, fast response, amplifying others messages, and so on.   It's not in the logic of these platforms to encourage slow, thoughtful, authentic discourse or to promote truth over falsehoods. I'm German and we haven't had much disinformation during this crisis and a reasonable response. That's not because human nature works different here than in the US, it's because people here get their information from scientists and public broadcasters, and there's legal punishment for misinformation on social media, and they have a duty to clean it up.

fwxk9p0,"So I'm torn between all of this. At first, I was very adamant on believing the numbers and not believing that they were being inflated until my grandmother was rushed to the ER and we were told she was positive for ""a touch of covid"". Never developed any symptoms and upon being released a week later, we immediately got her tested because the hospital 100% would not do a second test. Our main concern was that she had to be switched to a covid positive dialysis center and that would expose her to it. When they gave us her discharge papers, nothing on there about covid, yet when we all got tested we were given packets of what to do if we came back positive. Her first outside test came back negative and we were told she needed two negatives to return to her normal dialysis facility, so we immediately got her tested again. Thankfully that came back negative as well, so we were able to get her back in after only one visit to the covid positive center. I'd love to get her an antibody test to find out if she ever actually had it or if it was a ""false positive"".        Experiencing that first hand, it's hard not to think that hospitals are doing this for the extra money which in turn is driving the numbers up. If they would take advantage of an old lady coming in with no memory and not allowed to have any family around, why wouldn't they take advantage of a death? I'm not saying it's all ill tendencies, but I am saying that hospitals are hurting for money and a lot of CEOs see this as an opportunity to make some of that back. The hospital wouldn't retest her because they would have to forfeit the $13,000. In PA they removed a few hundred positives shortly into the pandemic and that was kind of proof that there was things like this going on.  Edit: not sure why my text comes out like this? Lol.

It sure seems   like randomly telling people that they’ll be dead soon from a vaccine that there is absolutely zero evidence has or will cause people to drop dead, is less rational “seeing through the bullshit” thinking, and more a desperate attempt to convince yourself of your moral and intellectual superiority, despite masses of evidence to the contrary.

I think the fact that they are mandated and that the mandates are based on this recommended list and schedule is part of why some people, even when faced with clearly medically based situations where standard procedure isn't completely appropriate, refuse to let that compute.   Their thought process only goes as far as ""This is the government recommendation, this is what's mandated, this is what we have to go by."" It wouldn't shock me at all if that mindset led to mistakes being made when it came to other kids outside the norm whose families or doctors may not have been as vigilant as mine were.   Basically, when it comes to medically warranted adjustments, I just think there needs to be a greater understanding of the need for flexibility and I'm less than convinced the current mandated schedule does a good enough job allowing for that.   I've been called anti-vax for questioning the wisdom of the mandates and the schedule before but I really don't think that makes me anti-vax, I think my view in general is vaccinate with your eyes open, be informed, get what you need even if it isn't on the list, and if you fit a group where a particular vaccine might have a greater risk for you, consult a doctor who knows what they're talking about.",VACCINES,2025-03-31 00:09:08,True,,negative

g0a6l12,"(FDIC) to estimate the average and median household balances in various types of banking and retirement savings accounts.   ...retirement savings Accounts? Various types of banking? Counting investments? There is no end to the amount of uncertainty given in this article. We dont have a clearly defined data set. And we dont know the rules by which it was picked. Which is relevant because any study only works in context. In context in which it was Designed. The context gives meaning to otherwise meaningless numbers. And if this context isnt understood one cannot simply Jump leaps and bounds and declare Information x valid in scenario y.  Statistics, even though missused alot in these ways, especially by shady Media Outlets, are not all applicable and very context dependent.   For example for the question At Hand one should ask how much money an american can on average spend for any shorttime emergency. This way we can answer the is 753$ alot or nah part.   But what u are comparing this scenario to is what people have in different parts of Investment which are probably partly not accesible because of Penaltys for withdrawal or generally locked until retirement if they even have those. And adding to that we dont even know if this study considered property as part of the value. So how much ur house might be worth if u bought or build one etc. We dont even know who was asked. Which part of the Population was interviewed for this. Probably not the homeless jeff around the corner from ur local burger joint.  So god damn many unknowns.   Aaaaaand to top aaaall of this of, no study that ever talks about the whole Population of a Nation asked everyone. Did they ask u? Aaall these studies do is: take a sample size of a certain group of people, defined by some arbitrarily chosen variable, ask maybe 50? Or in really good cases maybe around 5k-10k people (which are REALLY good cases and super fucking rare).   And from those answers they extrapolate their findings and ASSUME that they reflect the whole Population. Of course statistics has ways to prevent mishaps from happening such as these but there are so many ways to ask the question just the right way so ur data fits. Its really More a can u ask the right way and u will always get some weird Form of ""proof"". I mean flat earthers exist.  All of this to say: if u dont know who was asked and what the questions were u really cant judge a study. Especially since Media doesnt have a scientific Standard to reporting whatever findings they Think they have. Which is why some scientific papers get misquoted a whole lot. Because people twist things the way they want them to be. And as much as we might wanna believe it ,mathmetics isnt the unflinching truth some say it is.

My last Pfizer booster my MRSA infection- which I have largely kept under control without issue since it’s identification several years back flared up on my finger. At that time I specifically remember going to the Urgent Care center and querying the physician if there could be any sort of correlation. He looked at me like I was crazy and shut down my question.

Fast forward to this last Sunday and I got my bivalent Moderna booster. Sure enough two days later my MRSA again flared up- this time on my leg.

I have done some doctor Google research and found very little about this potential correlation. My question is twofold-

1) Does any sort of correlation make sense to those with a clinical background?

2) Where can I report this type of thing?

fl7qvdx,"Anyone know how to make this a thread? ppl asked and i have no idea  &#x200B;  i will give you guys an idea what extent the Chinese went with their lock-down, especially in Wuhan, to successfully contain this virus:  1. Each community would have its own whatsapp group ( wechat), every member of that group need to report body temperature taken daily ( this is for the whole country). Any symptoms at all need to be reported. For any unit that has ppl tested positive, they would have those giant yellow biohazard tapep across that unit door, like in the movies, and they would announce in the whatsapp group and alert everyone. 2. clearly all public space, transportation is shut. City to city border will be blocked so no one is allowed to travel at all. 3. For apartment building with multiple entrance point, all others except the main one will be sealed shut. There is at least one patrolman guarding each apartment. Anyone going in and out need to show their paper/permit on why they need to head out, **the reason for this to not only to contain the viruse, but also deter looting, stealing as all business are shut and left unguarded.** 4. You basically can't drive unless it's for some serious grocery haul. Some apartment just shut their garage door during the entire lock-down. 5. For any person taking a stroll randomly, or go on the street without permit, large fine, even arrest. If you run you get tazed ( bcs they think you might be out looting ) 6. For most cities the entrance to highway is blocked, you can't get out the city at all unless you walk the whole way, provided you don't get stop mid-way. 7. For anyone that's suspected carrying the disease ( I.E leaving wuhan before the city shutdown ) they will track you down and everyone you been in contact with on your way, mandatory quarantine. 8. And finally, people just take this incredibly seriously, family would not meet one another during the lock-down, it's not unusual for family member all staying at separate hotel rooms so they don't cross infect one another if one of their test come back positive. 9. Clearly some of these are quite drastic, but just keep in mind, the mentality in the society is that people are in this together, not brewing rebellion. So even measures are kind of over-the-top, but the patrolman, police enforcing it, do it with genuine care for the community. Ppl have a strong belief that they can get out of these together and everyone is doing their part, this is important as i see some citizens' behavior in other countries' current lock-down can only be described as irresponsible  For treatment:  1. They built a tons of make-shift containment center, so for anyone that's mildly sick, you get put in there and loaded up on antiviral drugs. one nurse can take care of up to 50 patients so it saves hospital beds for ppl who need more urgent care. 2. They also built a couple hospitals but only in Wuhan as the city's healthcare system collapsed. 3. Bcs rest of the country was not as heavily affected, there were something like 300K healthcare workers sent to Wuhan ( Hubei in general) later on to help out. that's 300K nurse and doctors, most went voluntarily, which is kind of nuts as that is more than the number of the patients, but then again, china quarantine anyone that's being suspected carrying the virus in those containment center, and most test end up negative. It's quite a feat none of those 300K are infected, 0. It helps they are all in full hazmat suit all the time. ( edit, by 0% i meant for the 300K sent to hubei when wuhan's own healthercare system collapsed, the doctors/nurses indigenous to wuhan seen 30% infection rate, and some hospital at the early stage would have their entire staff team infected bcs they are not wearing masks and etc, that was a big problem as more patients are coming in and fewer staff available, doctors were literally going non stop without sleep for full week ended up broken down, staffs are heavy on xanax, as hundreds of death pile up ) 4. and then clearly medical supplies were being made countrywide, in a couple wks they made billions of face masks.  Conclusion:  Wuhan certainly didn't beat this epidemics by just its own resource, the entire china helped, and even to this point, whilst the rest of the country has started to restore economic activity bit by bit, wuhan is till under strict lock-down. No park or any sort of business is open. No public transportation, things will likely remain the same till early April.  So you could see what measures have been put in place and it start to make sense why the mortality and R0 is substantially higher in almost anywhere else. Now i have been living in north america for almost a decade and have lived in Europe and Australia before, the few challenges i see with implementing some of the measures in western countries are:  1. ppl would likely not willing to share their travel history, and even if they do, travel history and contact history are private information thus wouldn't be openly shared with the neighborhood. So it's impossible to know if your neighborhood is safe or has the virus has been transmitting inside. 2. **ppl would argue total lock-down is violation of their freedom, human rights and etc for its own merit so a true real Marshall law style lock-down is likely not on the table. China implement a very stringent lock-down so after one month they would see 0 new case and people can get back to their life. A half-ass lockdown wouldn't stop transmitting, it would just slow it, so it will take almost forever to see 0 new cases and that defeats the whole purpose of the lock down. If there is still active undetected cases out there then soon as ppl get back to their normal life the outbreak would worsen instantly. i don't know why this is hard to understand. You need a true 0 new cases for the lockdown to make sense. Anything less than that it's a waste of time and resource.** 3. Media has been downplaying the danger, or just use China's number to model their projection but totally disregard the measures that were put in place 4. Also important to know that the Chinese manage to identify every single person carrying the virus, even those one show very little symptoms, and the mortality rate is based on that. 5. The mortality rate for flu is at 0.1% is because most of the cases are simply not detected, had you detect all the flu cases the real mortality rate is likely 1 in a hundred thousands or something like along that line. That's also the problem with much higher mortality rate in Italy, and soon in rest of EU plus US, which is there are not enough ppl being tested, if you are only testing the ones that are already in the hospital, then you are really just testing the 20% that are in a condition that need to be hospitalized ,and then of course the mortality rate among those group would be substantially higher. Remember for 100 person tested positive, 20 will need hospitalization, and 3 will need intensive care. **However what's happening right now is you are only testing that 20 person, so you will be looking at mortality rate of about 3/20 which would be around 15%, and i think we will likely see that as mortality rate in Italy keep climbing higher.** 6. Finally, is that Wuhan has the entire china behind supporting it, which is world second largest economy with the largest manufacturing power and plenty of medical personnel reserve, countries like Italy don't have that support system, when things start to collapse they can't reply on backup for help. So the best is to be as prepared as possible bcs everyone got their hands full if your healthcare system collapse that's pretty much game over.  The sooner the world start to learn and realize this, the sooner we can have this thing under control. Good luck everyone and stay safe.",Reddit_Comment,2020-03-22 20:04:04,True,,negative

mfy253p,"Some can be done together, preferably no more than 2 at a time (1 per arm) to reduce arm soreness, unless it's really urgent. MMR and Varicella (chicken pox) are live vaccines, so it's preferable to get those separately from other vaccines, and wait at least 28 days before and after each of them to get other vaccines.   Everyone (men and women) should get the HPV vaccine. It doesn't matter what your prior exposure is, nobody's had *every* variety of HPV already. And it doesn't matter what your current relationship status is, things can change, you don't know what might happen decades later. If you are under age 45, it is currently fully covered by insurance in the US, and you can just go to any in-network pharmacy, no prescription needed. There are 3 doses for full protection; the second is 2 months after the first, and the third is 6 months after the first.   For Hepatitis B, get the Twinrix combination shot - it adds Hepatitis A protection instead of only covering Hep B. There are 3 doses for full protection; the second is 1 month after the first, and the third is 6 months after the first.   The adult version of the Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis combination shot is called Tdap, the version for babies is DTAP. The tetanus protection is usually okay for 10 years, but revaccination is recommended every 5 years for people at higher risk of tetanus (this includes anyone who does gardening and/or construction/DIY), and the pertussis (whooping cough) protection doesn't even last that long for most people. So if it's being recommended for you again after 4 years, it wouldn't hurt to go ahead and get it again. Since it looks like you are in the US, ask an in-network pharmacy to check if your insurance will cover it now, or if you'll have to wait till the 5-year mark for coverage.   So, here's a possible timeline I'd suggest:   March: Flu (2024-2025 season) + HPV #1  April: Twinrix (Hep A & B) #1 + Tdap  May: Twinrix (Hep A & B) #2 + HPV #2  June: Varicella #1  July: MMR booster  August: Varicella #2  September: Covid (2025-2026 season) + HPV #3  October: Twinrix (Hep A & B) #3 + Flu (2025-2026 season)",VACCINES,2025-03-04 11:50:35,True,,negative

1g2wcci,"Hello, I am looking to see if others have had the same experience I have had with the COVID vaccine. I am a M38, have no serious medical conditions and my immune system is not compromised.

I just received my 4th shot since 2020.
Shots received are a mix of both Pfizer and Moderna 

The first shot I received with no issues. This is the one where you got the full vaccine in 2 doses. I went back for the booster a few months later..this is where I started getting complications:

About 1 minute after the vaccine was given I developed a high fever of about 39c that lasted for 10min. Each time the fever starts I begin to start blacking out. After about 20mins I am soaked in sweat and temperature is normalized enough to stand up and leave.

This reaction has happened for all of the shots I have received after the first. The nurses that administer the dose are certainly alarmed at the rapid onset but once 20mins is over with I am well enough to convince them I won't be a liability if I leave.

I understand that fever is a known side effect of the vaccine, however I did not expect my body to have a meltdown a mere 60 seconds after receiving the shot.

Im lucky in that I have a good job with remote option when needed. My job and industry is food so deemed essential. But thats not the case for everyone. People need money to live and if you don't protect their incomes they will still go out and about doing what theh want.

We should force the narrative to be ""freedom in the context of no harm to others""   versus ""there's others of us, asshole!!"".  As in.....yeah, if we could send trash into space for cheap, then....go ahead and liter up the depths of the void, but.....you shouldnt just have the freedom to, say, dump heavy metal-laden waste material, or over-hunt endagered species, or smoke indoor public spaces, or just go around grabbing them by ...their special areas.   So, yeah, you have the right not to wear masks....in the depths of nature, in your own home....but really, you think you should have the freedom to go to the market, and not wear it?!?!?     Just for context, cause we so often can lose sight, here's a list of other freedoms we don't usually complain about having to give up:  *   Stopping at a red light, at a crowded intersection in a major city, when there are cars coming from all directions. * Driving on the right side of the road, when there is on-coming traffic * pooping indoor, anywhere other then IN the TOILET * throwing grenades at people * stealing, murder,graft * Playing super loud music, late at night/early morning, in close proximity of residents who are likely sleeping  Just to illustrate, we generally accept that we are social creatures, we like to spent time with and around others, and we get, perhaps not always consciously, that we are compromising for the well-being and comfort of others.    Masks arent some liberal attempt at allowing riots to be more anonymous, or just a step towards making people accept orders from the government.

It's just I think that sadly the system is grown to be a sort of parasitic system by the journals. Still scientists have to work within it. Impact factor etc from published articles is vital to get those all important research grants. Some of the bigger problems with the current journal system I see is the lack of incentive to review articles and on some specific specialized fields especially its the select few reviewing most. Also how in the hunt for impact factor points has scientists cutting up their research in to multiple small as possible chunks to release as much as possible in the shortest possible time. This trend in my opinion on the long run will only produce worse science on all but the best journals, which is why they remain so prestigious.   Also seen a certain team do a pact to include eachothers names to all the articles they wrote even if the others hadn't even seen the paper. It did informally hurt their reputation locally at the university in question once noticed. With the propped up CV though, finding employment elsewhere was easier.

mv7b88l,"Discussion   ""...Overall, of all 100 mAbs we originally tested, only 21 mAbs were able to effectively bind to any SARS-CoV-2 antigen. Of those 21 mAbs, only six mAbs were capable of in-vitro neutralisation of any of the viruses, two of which only neutralised ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Given that all six the neutralising mAbs came from participants with two previous infections along with four to five vaccinations, our data seems to suggest that both monovalent vaccine platforms (ie, mRNA and protein) did not elicit robust plasmablast responses capable of overcoming immune imprinting, but that these antibodies were probably elicited by a recall response from past exposure(s). Therefore, our results assessing the B-cell responses at the monoclonal level from both vaccine platforms reinforce the conclusions of other studies indicating that these variant-specific monovalent vaccines might not be sufficient to elicit humoral immune responses to current and emerging variants of concern.""",COVID19,2025-05-31 06:06:25,True,,negative

My neck would lock up. I’d faint and vomit. SEVERE MIGRAINES. I was hospitalized multiple times. Had every test run on me. No explanation or causes found.. it’s extremely scary and I would have them almost every 4-5 weeks for 1.5 years. I haven’t had one in over a year but today my neck locked up and I’m on the verge of an episode.. really scared for this to start happening again. Has anyone experienced this?

I wear an ear piece for my walkie talkie that is always getting tangled in my mask straps. There are some days where it gets really fucking old and I just want to scream.

And these were original WT vaccines.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9286709/  See Table 2.  Omicron had extreme antibody escape when using WT vaccines. One dose would provide very little neutralization.  It seems highly likely that T-cell priming explains most of the drop in severity.  When we are talking about severity, like the OP study int his thread is, I do not think you have any evidence to say ""Omicron is too fast"".

Imagine someone saying, Look, these corks are only 0.5"" in diameter so it's no big deal plugging your nose all day.   The fact of the matter is, masks suck in a way regular clothing doesn't, which is why the world as a whole wasn't already clothing faces. They're stifling and they make it more frustrating for two people to communicate both by dulling speech and by obscuring the face which is an important tool in human interaction. I hate wearing a regular face mask while shopping and that's after a couple years' experience wearing an N95 for probably an hour a weekday.   Now consider the perspectives of the millions of employees who have to wear masks all day for long shifts at work, sometimes in hot places without air conditioning, while being told to buck up by, at least in some proportion, more privileged people who aren't physically exerting themselves, who are working at home or in offices where a mask isn't always necessary.

i got the flu shot and moderna booster 8 days ago (saturday) with a 1.5inch needle (i am a bigger person so i requested a longer needle according to the cdc guidelines on intramuscular vaccines in the deltoid region of the arm). i already have long covid and have for 2+ years. i was having a pretty normal immune response: chills, fatigue, nausea, etc for the first day or two. then on monday my feet and calves were numb and the right side of my face felt a bit strange. i went to urgent care and they did nothing. the next day it was creeping up my legs and hands and the right side of my face was numb and my vision was a bit blurry. i went to the ER where they did a cranial nerve exam and nothing else, sent me home. ruled out GBS and a stroke.  i was short of breath and struggling to think (some of my normal long covid symptoms but intensified). my face hasn't drooped at all, i'm able to move it but it feels numb. the numbness switches from right to left back to right, goes away and comes back. i've had 4 previous moderna shots and never felt like this. my legs aren't bothering me as much now but my face really is, as well as my vision. has anyone else been through this and has it gone away with time? i have a neurologist appointment next month.

You say it’s a moral duty to protect society by taking it but the consequences of taking it aren’t proven neither does the vaccine stop you shedding virus to anyone who chooses not to take it or can’t have it like pregnant women.  All any of these vaccines are is a paracetamol for a headache, they are not a cure.  Your view on morals is your view that’s fine no ones segueing that but just remember people who choose not to be vaccinated that is also their choose and you must respect that and when you discuss morals it sounds to me like you’re not.  For any vaccine to work over 80% of the population of a given country would need to be immunised that won’t happen period so it’s likely not going to work on that basis.  Secondly no one can say when the vaccine cut of point is from when you’re protected to when you’re not, what that means in simple terms there are likely to be millions of people walking around thinking they’re protected when they’re not!!!  This rushed out attempt will IMO lead to worse pain than social distancing and face mask wearing because the whole population will give up in the belief they’re invincible on the promise of a vaccine.  Reiterate no one has ever created a vaccine that stops upper respiratory tract infection you will still get COVID 19, how unlucky is that code someone who’s sick and puts their trust in a vaccine and ends up in a situation where it’s doesn’t protect them, I personally think that’s bad for all.

NOT my opinion, And I certainly didn’t ask for your swill of an opinion. I’m providing an account, for people to make their own decisions. Fuck you for telling me I’ve murdered my child. Sick fucking people. You don’t give a shit about whether she lives or dies; you care about being right. **

Hi all, I wanted to share my child’s vaccine experience- as it is not “all clear, nothing to report”.

First- she’s mostly healthy. She has adhd, autism, has mild asthma. She’s chronically underweight, and in the 98% for height. Read: tall and thin.

First Pfizer shot: no symptoms. Typical sore arm, but otherwise she was asymptomatic. 

Second Pfizer shot: hoooo boy we were not prepared. She’s been sick for almost two weeks. The first day she was sleepy, went to bed early. Woke up on day 2 with a fever of 101.6. This continued for 4 days. Fever of 100-101 that stubbornly hung on. She was so, so tired. I had to help her up the stairs to bed. Terrible appetite. She’d stand up and immediately have to sit back down. She’s not a complainer, and on day 3, she collapsed back on the couch after trying to stand up, and she starts to cry and says “my knees hurt so much. I’m not old! Why do my knees hurt???”. Poor girl, she’s had a hard time. 
Fever went down after day 4, but clung around 99. She has slowly worked up her energy. 

Today, day 12…. After not having a fever for days… it creeps back in. Her fever was 100.0. Said her body ached, and she barely ate any dinner. 

That’s it. Just wanted to tell you what her experience has been. Take care all!",Vaccine,2021-11-30 13:17:37,True,,positive

Some in medical freedom committee will support…  Any centralized committee, no matter how well-intentioned, will be captured by Big Pharma. They will lobby to shape who is on the committee, what data are included and excluded, and what questions are asked. Furthermore, the CDC obviously cannot be trusted to investigate itself given that it is potentially criminally implicated in covering up the harms of vaccines.

To start this is what I understand on covid deaths and how the vaccine works 
As far as I know 2.5% of people infected die (yes that's a large amount of people cause of how easy it spreads I understand) 
And the vaccine doesn't lower the chance of infectious just lowers the chance of death 

If this isn't true please comment a link explaining how this works 


How ever If that's true then what difference dose it make to people who are vaccinated if others don't have the vaccine ? 

Like on a smaller scale example but let's change the death%to 100% (if not vaccinated) 
And people who are vaccinated survival is 100% to make my question even simpler

Say there's 100 people on a island and 1 person has covid 19 
25/100 are not vaccinated 

Won't the 25 who are not vaccinated just die ? And the rest of the people will just carry on with out issue like if the vaccine is good then people who are not vaccinated are only hurting them selfs ?

lp9j5ms,"OP, if you genuinely want to learn from others, stop using pejorative terms when asking questions--i.e., calling people who are skeptical or hesitant about the COVID jabs ""anti-vaxxers"". The term is intended as an insult, as if the person were stupid, deliberately ignorant, and/or profiting in some way from not taking the jabs or speaking against them. It would be like someone calling you a vaxtremist and a grifter for your pro-vax stance, implying that you were making money from pushing the jabs in spite of knowing there are problems with them.  I follow a substack by a doctor from the midwest US who has written several long, detailed articles on the idea of the mRNA vaccine shedding. Like you, they and their colleagues believed that theoretically, it shouldn't be possible for these jabs to shed. But they were seeing too much evidence of shedding to ignore it.   The possible mechanisms they came up with included vaccinated people being asymptomatically infected with COVID and transmitting the actual virus; shedding of bacteria that had been transfected with mRNA; and something called exosome mediated shedding.  >While not perfect, exosome shedding is the hypothesis that best fits the existing data on shedding. Briefly, this hypothesis argues that the vaccine is concentrating in the lungs (due its previously described affinity for the pulmonary arteries when the vaccine is incorrectly manufactured), which results in some (but not all vaccinated) individuals exhaling a significant amount of spike protein containing exosomes which then affect those in their surrounding. This mode of “shedding transmission” essentially allows for a relatively small difference in total spike protein concentration between the shedder and the individual affected by the shedder.

But vaccinated and boosted people people have the benefit of having less severe symptoms and typically fairing better than they would if they weren’t vaccinated. Very similar to the flu shot. It won’t necessarily stop you from getting the flu but it helps you not get it as bad. And the less symptomatic you are the less likely you are to spread it(you can still spread it but not as much or as bad as if you’re coughing and sneezing).   And these vaccines have been all FDA approved for 6 months and up. We’ve seen good data for safety. I was double vaccinated while pregnant and boosted while breastfeeding. I also got my baby vaccinated at 9 months. We’re all doing great and none of us have actually caught Covid yet even though we were closely exposed 4 times. And my baby hasn’t been negatively impacted by the vaccines. She’s in the 90th percentile for weight and height. She’s developmentally on track or advanced in her skills. And she’s overall very healthy. I 100% don’t regret my decision to get her or myself vaccinated.   Also whether it’s evolved to a “mild” virus is up for debat. I have friends who said it was very mild and nbd. And friends who said they felt like death and it was horrible ( mostly it was non boosted friends who got it bad). At least death rates seem lower but that could be due to do many different elements at play. I really do hope it continues to evolve to something mild, because at this rate that’s honestly best case scenario. Vaccines isn’t going to get rid of it cause we know not enough people would take it for that to ever happen.",CovidVaccine,2022-10-06 05:39:09,True,,negative

fn7zs6l,">Why aren’t the police stopping people from entering the church is the real question?  Aside from the 1st... it's because it's not a crime.  Drunk driving is a crime. The governors of the various states cannot create criminal law.  I am not condoning it, I am not saying they aren't idiots (church-goers), but it's not a crime and the police have no authority to stop someone going to church. The only authority they have is to issue fines, which is why they did that and all of them will be overturned and not paid anyway.  The governor knows that if they start arresting people for going to church, two things will happen:  1. It will go to court where they will lose all authority on the issue. 2. They will be voted out in the next election.  Fines are fine, but slapping the cuffs on a bunch of mostly old people is poor optics.  Reddit isn't real life.  Our outrage here does not translate.

lmj7vxi,"You have to remember, that in the history of humanity, no vaccine has had anything close to 90+% effectiveness when the variant is matched, for an extremely infectious and deadly disease, as the mRNA technology has conferred. This was necessary as well as effective, in one of the most deadly epidemics when the population of the world has been at the highest ever. So the mRNA technology has conferred a very high effectiveness, at the cost of high side-effects.  I too get fever for 2 days and severe body-aches with Moderna's every dose. Yet, I will continue to take Moderna, preferring it over Pfizer because it has a higher dosage of the antibody generation, proven for multiple boosters. I have also not ever caught Covid, leading a normal life with sensible precautions like wearing masks around strangers, outdoor lunches/dinners and such. That's how science, risk and results work.  Some of my relatives and acquaintances did not have access to mRNA vaccines in other parts of the world, and despite taking other (non-mRNA) vaccines with less side-effects, have actually died from the Delta variant, despite being vaccinated.

gegcuk3,"The Phizer and Moderna vaccines are both mRNA vaccines. These types of vaccines have been theoretical and in development for a while, but they have never had one that is effective...until now. A traditional vaccine uses either virus fragments or whole dead virus to trigger your immune system into making antibodies. Your cells remember that virus/anti-body combination and if it comes into contact with that same virus again it remembers how to fight it.   mRNA vaccines don't contain any virus. Instead, they alter your cells DNA in a way that it will then ""know"" how to fight the virus. At least that's my understanding from what research I've done. Since this is the first working vaccine of this type, we really don't have a plethora of data showing what, if any, long term effects it may have. It could be great and revolutionize vaccines.

That was not the problem as there was ample food available to eat in Ireland \*but\* the average Irishman (especially a Catholic Irishman) was simply too poor to afford the food that was at market. Potatoes were important in Ireland because they were a cheap source of food that average people could afford. During the famine Ireland continued to export tremendous amounts of foodstuff to England. To put the potato famine in context, there had previously been a famine in Ireland and the crisis was ameliorated by an export ban on foodstuffs (this lowered food prices in Ireland). No such ban was instituted during the famine because the rich landowners (read, the English) did not want to lose out on their profits.   In many ways, the potato famine is an early form of corporate greed (i.e., profits before human life).

If anyone is genuinely curious as to how you'd go about ET here's a good starting point:   Start off small. Maybe it's by just sanitizing your hands and fitting the mask on in the mirror then taking it off again. Doing this repeatedly will help you get used to the act of simply putting the mask on, which is step one.Again, the key with exposure therapy is to keep small and build comfort, not a ""all or nothing"" approach.   Build on that comfort by wearing your mask at home while maybe getting dressed, a maybe 5 minute activity. Something where you can put the mask on, do a quick task and then take it off again.    Then try something that spans a longer time period such as making breakfast or watching a TV show. Something that is still familiar to you in a safe space, but takes more effort to do.

I'm medicated but that only stops panic attacks. I'm only used to my needs because I was in the hospital and figured I'm under the care of nurses if I get a bad side effect. If I'm at home I won't take new medicines.  I do get flu shots because Im used to that since a kid. If I started the Covid shots again for my own benefit I was just curious.

fkw09ck,"This is exactly correct. You get bailed out, you get bailed out by having the government become an owner of the company. Either in the form of equity, or better yet, preferreds, so they can't pay a dividend or buy back stock until the government is fully paid back with interest.   I was advocating for this in 2008 and I will continue to advocate for it now. Bailouts are not free. Make the companies taking them pay back the American taxpayer with interest and people will be more careful about this in the future.  Edit: ""Forever"" is too long (also if it's only buybacks and not dividends that is a meaningless restriction) because at that point the equity holder would prefer to just go bankrupt and collect the recovery value, which would be higher than owning a stock that could never distribute cash again. Also you'd have to account for mergers, etc. if they were bought by someone else. The correct way to do this in finance, and it's a solved problem, is with preferred stock or senior debt with covenants that prohibit buybacks and dividends until it is paid off. I assume Cuban ultimately meant this as he knows what he is talking about but was just speaking off the cuff. Point is, you want a bailout?

xhm297,"Hello everyone, 

I received 3 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the third one being a whole year ago. With the upcoming surge we will be seeing as we move into fall and winter, I am eager to bolster my protection in addition to the other mitigation measures I take (I am a teacher that works around almost entirely unmasked students/colleagues and I have underlying health problems/am immunocompromised). However, I am reluctant to get another mRNA vaccine for a number of reasons, primarily because we clearly can't keep up with the evolution of the virus and Novavax is more universal. 

My question is: Has anyone who is fully vaccinated with mRNA vaccines had any luck finding a loophole to convince a provider to administer Novavax given that it's not currently approved as a booster? If it's not yet approved as a standalone booster to compliment mRNA vaccines, could we simply get both Novavax shots as a complete primary series? Do pharmacists check the vaccine database to see if you're already vaccinated? I am in Maryland and the government website says people can self-attest to eligibility and that ""COVID-19 vaccine providers cannot turn away any individual who self-attests to eligibility for an additional dose or booster dose. Failure of an individual to 'show proof' of eligibility may not be a reason that a provider does not administer an additional or booster dose."" I suppose I could always go to the pharmacy and see what happens, but was curious if anyone had had any luck.

flcr1tj,"Pretty sure that happened to me. I was in immense pain every day so I finally started taking the pain meds I was prescribed more regularly. Then I started taking two at a time because one wasn’t doing anything anymore at all. It was all I could do for pain relief. I still begged for other pain medication alternatives but because of kidney problems everything other than opioids was quickly dismissed by my doctor. I took the maximum of 8 tablets a day at some point and it just wasn‘t doing much. I was still suffering. It had helped initially and it did seem to numb the pain for a little while but not completely.  In the end I went to therapy and said I need to learn how to manage this pain because I couldn’t do this anymore. I didn’t want to get out of bed anymore at all. And being in bed all day made the pain even worse.   My therapist suggested a bunch of techniques I felt were idiotic. Like charting every hour how I felt and what my pain level was and how many pain meds I had taken. But I started doing it. It showed me how much of a habit it had become - I thought I only took the medication when the pain was bad. Tracking it showed me quickly that without noticing I took them within the same hour every day. Of course that’s partly because it only lasts so long so the pain will start up again at the same time but I didn’t even take them the same time every morning (I tried to last as long as possible every morning without taking anything). And then she asked I count the total number of pain meds I take every week. And try to reduce it just by a little every week. And find ways to distract myself. Instead of sitting at work all day, I should go to for a walk when the pain became unbearable. I should go get a glass of water and talk to colleagues in the kitchen. Anything to distract myself from the pain. I thought it would be pointless - the pain was so bad there was no way I could go with less pain medication.  Within two weeks I was down to 2 pain meds a day. Within 3 weeks I was completely off. I had started taking CBD oil to help with the pain, I had started going for more walks and set meetings spread throughout my day instead all at once. So I was constantly moving around and changing my day up. I had also bought capsicum and cbd creme. Distraction was important I learned and often very hard to achieve. Stress was the worst. My therapist let me message her whenever I needed. So when it got bad or when I was stressed I sent her a message and got a response that calmed me down or gave me new ideas on how to distract myself. I suddenly was also distracted by the side effects from withdrawals which I now think may have even helped. Withdrawals felt better than the pain. Though it was hard not being able to sleep at times. The CBD helped a bit with that after a while.   Some days were so horrible that I sent my therapist a message one day after 3 weeks of being clean that if it meant I needed to go through this pain constantly now then life isn’t worth living. So she said to take a pill. Her allowing me to do so made me feel better about my need to take one. So much that I lasted another day without one. The next day I caved because it became unbearable. But I only took one at a time and two total. It became bearable again after a few days and I stopped taking them again.   I was able to start doing sports more regularly again which in turn also reduced my pain.  Nowadays I go weeks without taking any pain medication. Which is good because my doctor changed and my new one won‘t prescribe me unlimited opioids anymore (my previous doctor had even stopped asking and I simply needed to click a button online to get a new prescription sent to the pharmacy). She doesn’t understand the level of pain I sometimes go through and it scares me to think what would have happened to me if I had her before I had been able to reduce my intake. I had no way of dealing with the pain before - it was unbearable. But she also has a point. Ideally I would have a doctor at a middle ground between the two. One who understands I need pain relief but also one that pays attention and ensures I don‘t end up completely addicted.  The problem with opioids is that you need increasingly larger doses to do the same job. If you fully rely on them you need more and more to get the same pain relief you used to get from a single dose. I now am back to being able to get relief from the smallest dose but back then it didn’t do even a dent.",Reddit_Comment,2020-03-24 09:39:29,True,,negative

The vaccine targets the spike protein, which is what binds to the cells in our respiratory tract.  In order to evade the vaccine, the spike protein will have to change. But if it changes too much, it can't bind to our cells and infect us anymore.  It is threading a very thin needle.  Now, you might point out that the vaccine efficacy has been slightly eroded.  This is true, sort of.  The delta variant is just so much more infectious and is leading to larger viral loads that are overwhelming people's antibodies, so they are getting sick.  The vaccine still works, it is just getting overwhelmed.  That is why the boosters they are looking at won't even be of another, updated vaccine.

I am 30sF, have been experiencing continuous bleeding since first vaccine dose of Pfizer. I have made a VAERS report. I have never had COVID; I had to test twice weekly (PCR) for work throughout the entire pandemic. I also have been tested for antibodies prior to vaccination, negative result. 

I did another round of bloodwork, and was additionally checked for some rarer cancers, Hashimotos, and von Wilenbrans. I detailed all of the other tests that I had to check for alternative causes in the past post, several of them (the pelvic, transvaginal ultrasound, and blood panel) were also repeated. Vitamin levels also normal (I live in a *very* northern climate so I have been supplementing with Vitamin D for most of my life). I am currently receiving iron supplements for anemia brought on by this extended menstrual bleeding, and will also be starting a GrNH agonist tomorrow to try and get it to stop. I will also be starting vaginal progesterone supplements in an attempt to re-regulate my menstrual cycle (a process more similar to IVF).  

My doctors have agreed that the most likely explanation for the cause of this continuous bleeding was the first Pfizer dose, and have recommended that I not receive the second.",Vaccine,2021-07-03 02:24:18,True,,negative

Instead of drafting the private sector early on to develop tests, as South Korea did, U.S. health officials relied, **as is customary**, on test kits prepared by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some of which proved faulty. Then, sticking to its time-consuming vetting procedures, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration didn’t approve tests other than the CDC’s until Feb. 29, more than five weeks after discussions with outside labs had begun.  >Meanwhile, in the absence of enough kits, the CDC insisted for weeks on narrow criteria for testing, recommending it only when a person had recently been to China or other hot spots or had contact with someone known to be infected. As a result, the federal government failed to screen an untold number of Americans and missed opportunities to contain the spread, clinicians and public health experts say.  >South Korea took a risk, releasing briskly vetted tests, then circling back later to spot check their effectiveness. By contrast, the United States’ FDA said it wanted to ensure, upfront, that the tests were accurate before they went out to millions of Americans.  The above scenario was already built in to our response no matter who the president would be. How would another president fix the above? They would have listened to the FDA and their guidance on vetting the tests.   The way our government is set up, which has its pros and cons, contributes to this. Other countries are more nimble when it comes to responding to a crisis. We've gotten better at responding to disasters, but for this, the traditional way of doings things wasn't enough.

I got vaccinated with BionTech Pfizer on May 5th 2021, June 8th 2021 and Jan 17th 2022.

One day after the second vaccination I started recognising small dots/flashes of light happening in my vision. Mostly they were very small, like a fly, and stayed there for half a second.

It was like: one flash, … 10 min no flash, one flash, … 1 min no flash, …

in this way it happended unregularly throughout the day. Have been to hosptial because I also got heavy Diarrhoe for 3 weeks and an intermitting droopy left eyelid (intermitting ptosis throughout the day, every myasthenia gravis test was negative).

Did many vision tests, brain MRT, blood tests, brain CT, … exactly nothing was found.

Docs just ignored my suspicion that it‘s from the vaccine because it‘s safe and it causes no symptoms like this.

After two months or so it disappeared slowly.

I got the third vacc now on Jan 17th 2022. And gues what: One day after the vacc my flashes and dots came back and so did my droopy eyelid.

It‘s unbelievably hard to find a doc in Austria who believes you.

This is when Amazon lists it as sold by and a name.  But there is another method where you are basically consigning it to Amazon and you ship to their warehouse and they do everything else.  They take a bigger cut but you set the prices.  These are listed as “Sold By Amazon” which means Amazon is doing all of the leg work but someone else is setting the prices (and what is sold).  This is how my wife’s company (previous) used to sell their products because it was easier for them.  The “Sold By Amazon” just means that they have to comply with Amazon standards in terms of accuracy, and policies.    Smile brand, AmazonBasics and maybe a few others are Amazon.  That is their products by them.   Now Amazon should be doing a much better job screening those who list with them.

Someone close to me has sort of ""come out"" to me as Anti Vax.

They travel a lot and they said they'd only consider vaccinating if they were forced to stay here (in the EU) or not allowed to come back in as a result of being unvaccinated.

I pushed back a bit, at first just asking politely that they reconsider and then (after being shot down immediately) Suggesting that their fears don't seem to line up with reality.

So far they've used supposed anecdotes to justify their mistrust of all doctors and to argue that all vaccines cause heart problems.

They have since threatened very drastic things (the sort that requires euphemisms on some social networks) and I do not want to lose this person.

They have helped me through very rough times and I feel like it is my time to do the same.

Someone in the highest tax bracket would pay taxes on a dividend at the rate of regular income - up to 37% federally, plus state and local.  But buybacks aren't technically given to the stockholder - they just artificially raise the price of each share by buying and eliminating other shares.

flcfjpb,"**Me generation**  The ""Me"" generation in the United States is a term referring to the baby boomer generation and the self-involved qualities that some people associate with it. The 1970s were dubbed the ""Me decade"" by writer Tom Wolfe; Christopher Lasch was another writer who commented on the rise of a culture of narcissism among the younger generation of that era. The phrase caught on with the general public, at a time when ""self-realization"" and ""self-fulfillment"" were becoming cultural aspirations to which young people supposedly ascribed higher importance than social responsibility.  ***  **Self-help**  Self-help or self-improvement is a self-guided improvement—economically, intellectually, or emotionally—often with a substantial psychological basis.   When engaged in self-improvement, people often utilize publicly available information or support groups, on the Internet as well as in person, where people in similar situations join together. From early examples in self-driven legal practice and home-spun advice, the connotations of the word have spread and often apply particularly to education, business, psychology and psychotherapy, commonly distributed through the popular genre of self-help books. According to the APA Dictionary of Psychology, potential benefits of self-help groups that professionals may not be able to provide include friendship, emotional support, experiential knowledge, identity, meaningful roles, and a sense of belonging.Many different self-help group programs exist, each with its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, leaders.  ***  ^([ )[^(PM)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space)^( | )[^(Exclude me)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme)^( | )[^(Exclude from subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/about/banned)^( | )[^(FAQ / Information)](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)^( | )[^(Source)](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v0.28)",Reddit_Comment,2020-03-24 05:49:57,True,,positive

holzz01,"I just wanted to add my experience. I got my second Pfizer dose at the end of May, but I didn’t notice my patch of alopecia areata until October 1. It’s possible I was shedding earlier but didn’t notice since I typically shed a lot. I have never had AA before or any hair related issues. My parents have plenty of hair with no hair issues.   My dermatologist gave me a steroid injection on October 23 (because I couldn’t get in earlier), but hair was already started to grow back.   When I went in for my second round of steroid injections, the spot had about doubled in size. The nurse practitioner noticed shedding, but I didn’t think anything of it when she mentioned it.   Two weeks later at the end of November, the shedding started to increase. These first two weeks of December it’s ramped up even more. As far as I know, I was super healthy in the beginning of the year. My annual check up bloodwork also came back normal. I am going to have thyroid, hormone and whatever other tests run soon, but I honestly feel no other symptoms of being unwell. I started to suspect the vaccine, but only really looked into it online yesterday and found all of your posts. I am a little relieved to know that I am not alone and I feel like since I didn’t seem to find hair loss till so much later, nobody will really believe me when I say I think it’s related, including the doctors.   If it’s just the AA that will regrow and TE which will also regrow, ok fine, I’ll figure it out and recover. But the booster and the idea of needing boosters regularly is worrying me. I suppose the calculation is that it’s better to lose hair than get really sick, but it doesn’t make it any easier. One previous poster said she cut all her hair off and mentally felt freer. I’m not at the point where I have to do that but if the shedding doesn’t stop I’m probably a couple weeks out since my AA patch is right on top of my head. My husband has been saying to just shave it all off so I don’t feel the stress of handfuls of hair everyday and to just feel like my hair is progressing everyday. I’m kinda coming around to that idea.",CovidVaccine,2021-12-15 05:30:10,True,,negative

Personally, I'm in favor of the true definitions of both, but in this case, I think it is important to look past that to the point.  The Republicans have essentially defined socialism to mean any program that takes away personal responsibility for your current situation.  This includes practically any government program focused on a large number of individuals.  In this case, both paid sick leave and $1000 payouts IS Republican Socialism.   They are in favor of it now because they are clearly affected by the issues on a large scale and find that there really are reasons why a person may be put in an unwinnable situation despite not being ""lazy"" or ""irresponsible"" or ""dumb"".  Of course, they will try hard not to make the connection that there really isn't much difference between helping people out now vs helping people out on a regular basis.  Both now and reguarlly will lead to the same amount of social stability, economic gain, and general happiness maintenance.  However, the Republican base will try their hardest not to think that.  That's why it's very important to point out this is a *Republican* Socialist program, and less important to point out that technically the Republicans altered the meaning of the word to be anti-government in general and the true meaning of socialism wouldn't include this.",Reddit_Comment,2020-03-16 19:48:24,False,,negative

I brought up my concerns to my pediatrician at the 2-month appointment, and she reassured me that the vaccines are safe, well-studied, and necessary to protect my baby.

I was feeling more confident about sticking to the recommended schedule, but now my MIL has been messaging me, urging me to space them out. She keeps mentioning how all the preservatives at once are “too much for such a little body” and that I should really reconsider, especially since she isn’t going to be going to daycare. Now, I’m second-guessing myself again, even though I want to trust my pediatrician.

Did anyone else feel this way? How did you handle family members pushing against the recommended schedule? And if you were nervous about vaccines, what helped you feel more at ease?

n8uh93i,"RFK Jr has a basic misconception on how vaccines work in the human body. He, like most anti-vax proponents, thinks that vaccines should prevent viral illnesses. Vaccines don't do that.  Vaccines are designed to give the human immune system a biological ""warning"" for a specific virus. This enables the immune system to respond vigorously once the targeted virus infects the individual. This reduces the severity and damage of the viral infection, but is limited by the effectiveness of the individual's immune system.  Vaccines aren't perfect: they only work once a viral infection attacks the person, but biologically they are amazingly effective, and the best approach that we have to dealing with viral diseases.",Coronavirus,2025-08-15 15:20:36,True,,negative

1fd3wl8,"I received the original Moderna mRNA vaccine early in 2021 and received two boosters later that same year. I received all my childhood vaccines as well as occasional flu vaccines and a tetanus booster throughout the years, and the only side effect I ever recall having was a bit of inflammation around the injection site when I had my meningococcal vaccine at 16. Nothing else, not even feeling a little under the weather, from any other vaccine. 

But the COVID-19 vaccine was just so hard on my body, despite supposedly having less side effects than a traditional vaccine. Each time I had a booster, the side effects were worse. I ran a fever and had awful body aches and chills. I got a big red welt on my arm at the injection site each time I received the vaccine and the pain was so bad I could barely move my arm for a couple days. I even started having heart palpitations shortly after getting my second booster, but I'm not 100% sure that it was related. The timing has made me really scared of getting the new boosters that have come out in the years since. 

I've never had anything like that happen with any other vaccine, and it's made me scared to get another booster, but I would like to be protected from more of the crud that kids pass around that I get exposed to as a teacher. Why would this vaccine be so hard on my body? Is it possible it's because it was an mRNA formulation, and if so, would I be safe to try the Novavax vaccine instead?

fkypi4u,"sure.  The only reason gloves are protective is because they keep things off your hands.  But that's more useful for things that can go through your skin or any small cuts, etc.  Or things that are dangerous to have on your skin like acid.  When you're talking about droplet transfer of a lipid encased virus that is easy to kill with soap and water or hand sanitiser, gloves are less useful.  They can actually be worse than hands, because people think they are protected and stop being careful.  Gloves don't stop you from touching things, and picking up virus on your hands.  If you think they are making you safe, you may keep touching things and transfering virus, and not make such an effort to be aware of what you are doing.  People wearing gloves and using their phone...will be touching that phone with bare hands later and picking up all the stuff they had on their gloves, for instance.  Or you may transfer virus from the gloves to your hands when you remove the gloves, and think your hands are safe because they were inside the gloves.  It is just as easy to transfer virus from surface to surface with gloves on, and just as easy to keep the same habits with gloves as with bare hands.  Some people say ""oh gloves remind me not to touch my face."".  May I suggest we leave the gloves for the people who really need them (I work in a pharmacy and a lab, and have to handle products that will go through my skin or cause me illness or damage that way...we can't get gloves right now)?  If you think a reminder will help you stop touching your face or licking your fingers, take a marker and colour the tip of your fingers.  And wash your hands.  Soap and water is just fine, if you can (better than sanitiser).  Sanitizer if you have it and can't wash.  (eta:  caveat - if you are in a situation where you have to wash so often that your hands are getting sore or broken skin, wear a single pair of gloves as ""job skin"" and wash your hands whie wearing the gloves as if the gloves are your actual skin, just for the purpose of saving your own skin from excess washing - the same gloves are fine to wear for this purpose for a full shift or until they break)",Reddit_Comment,2020-03-19 21:30:54,False,,negative

My issue with that is it took 3 years to publish as the researchers were so worried about the impact on their careers due to the “suppression of misinformation” when they are clear we are suffering immensely. That’s a massive problem as the public don’t know we exist and even eminent doctors are scared to treat us or admit treating us. Can you even imagine how that feels? It’s a literal living nightmare.

I've never been able to square his support of Trump with my knowledge of who he is as a person. I really don't discuss politics with him, because he is an essential part of my work and I'm not trying to sow discord. He's over 60 as is his wife, although neither have any underlying conditions. I'm going to chalk it up to the idea that he suffered from Hillary derangement syndrome in 2016 and hold out hope that as the November election draws nearer, he will let me know that he's going to cast his ballot for Biden. It really wouldn't surprise me.   Another man who recruited me into the company where I've been for 11 years also voted for Trump in 2016, stating that while he didn't particularly like him, he absolutely hated Hillary Clinton and didn't want to throw his vote away on a third party candidate. he reached out to me right before the Virginia primaries asking me to please cast a ballot for Biden (if you remember, the race was still really competitive at that time in early March). I let him know that Virginia is an open primary state, and he could cast a ballot as well. We do not vote by party identification here in the primary elections. He seemed alternately thrilled and mystified, but he did show up and cast a ballot for Biden. I think one of the big differences in 2020 is that everyone who took a risk on Trump reluctantly in 2016 is seeing how that's worked out, and also Biden is not Clinton.

flr2gpm,"I ordered something the day before panic set in. It was a 32oz bottle of Hibiclens. I actually need it for something. Anyway, $24 that day, and I was supposed to get it in two days. Next day, panic sets in. The shipping notification comes that my item will be delayed... Happens sometimes. No biggie. A week goes by, a new shipping email. Same thing. I get annoyed and check Amazon. Same bottle, same seller, many in stock, price is doubled. I sit on it. Another handful of days, another email. I start getting annoyed. I call Amazon. No answer - email only now. I email Amazon. No answer. A few more days, another shipping email. It finally shipped, two weeks after I ordered it. I’m 100% convinced they wanted me to return the item and rebuy it, or they just didn’t wanna send it because other people were willing to pay twice what I did. The panic drives me nuts. I need to use this stuff every couple of weeks on a persistent issue from the military that the VA refuses to accept as a service related problem, and no doctor wants to touch because it’s not a major problem, except for when it flares up.

Yes, they're facing the public, but they're encountering a 1-2% chance of facing a coronavirus patient each time, and for the most part at some distance, and not the most severe cases.  Medical professionals are coming into close contact with 100% chance of coronavirus patients, doing procedures that directly spray fluids and virus particles in the air, and face the most severe cases with the highest viral loads, and are also getting the highest exposures to a disease where the viral loads hhave a significant impact on how severe it is.  There's a reason why medical professionals represent like 10-20% of the deaths in every country - and you don't see a similar percentage of grocery store workers getting taken down.\  It is a considerably higher risk.  (i.e. it's the difference between the risk taken by say, a contractor sent to Iraq to cook up meals in the barracks, vs. soldiers sent out to directly fight insurgents - (yes, both are put in to a situation where they're at risk of harm, but the risks are considerably higher for the latter).",Reddit_Comment,2020-05-06 17:42:29,True,,positive

1n8rx67,"ETA: not looking for “it has fewer side effects” or “people are more comfortable with non-MRNA vaccines” but the reason why they appear to be the gold standard in COVID-cautious communities (:

Looking forward to getting my updated COVID shot in the near future (shoutout to Massachusetts and its continued belief in and advocacy for vaccine access!)

I’ve been mostly a Moderna devotee besides getting an updated Novavax 2 months after an updated Moderna last fall/winter. I’m COVID cautious but due to just being alive I always strive for highest efficacy and longest protection. 

I often see people say they’ll only get Novavax and will even delay getting a vaccine until they can get it this year. I haven’t been able to find the often cited “it’s better and longer lasting” info and I would really like to both for my own knowledge and also to share with folks looking to make a choice on which to get.

12zo9pj,"I've been dealing with chronic epididymitis (right testicle) for nearly 2 years now, after it started as a side effect after my 2nd covid vaccine shot in June 2021.

I recently decided to do ANA test, out of suspicion it might be autoimmune related. First ANA test came positive (1:320 homogenous), but I had COVID at the exact time of doing it, so I repeated in March. Came back positive again, but this time I decided to do an anti-smooth muscle antibodies test and that came back positive too (often indicative of autoimmune hepatitis).

The weird thing is, almost everything liver related is normal, except ALT above reference points (87 IU/L \[10.0 - 60.0\]; and C-reactive protein coming 5 (<5.0) right after COVID in December, then 14 in March:

\- AST is normal.

\- Bilirubin - normal.

\- Mitochondrial antibodies - negative.

\- Anti liver-kidney - negative.

\- IgG (A, M and G) - normal levels. Haven't done IgG4 yet.

\- Hepatitis B & C - negative.

\- All other liver enzymes - normal levels.

I followed up with gastroenterologist privately and he said he doesn't seem that concerned and that the positive ASMA + CRP could be higher due to me having COVID in December and also taking antibiotics for the epididymitis by the time I did the 2nd set of tests in March. I also never even had jaundice or another single symptom related to AIH.

He told me to lose weight (I am obese and also have fatty liver for 8 years now), alcohol and food consumption and repeat these tests in a month or two. If they've gone down, it might not be autoimmune hepatitis. He also referred for a fibroscan (ultrasound) of the liver.

I'd ideally like to avoid a biopsy (the gold standard in diagnosing AIH), so wanted to ask if anyone else has had a positive ASMA test, but didn't turn out to be AIH?

Thank you.",Vaccine,2023-04-27 01:18:45,True,,negative

The US is an incredibly young country compared to the ones this pandemic has ravaged and it took many years to get it to where it is now but before that people had to rely only on themselves and their family to survive and build a life here.  Basically the founding of the US made our people scared to rely on anything but themselves and are immediately suspicious of any sort of outside help or well any help at all.

Published in 1993  >the novel features a City Watch commander named Captain Samuel Vimes. The Captain is set to marry one of the richest women in the world, and he often opines about the differences between low-status and high-status spending habits.  >At one point in the story, the Captain ruminates:   ""Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.  But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.""",Reddit_Comment,2020-12-03 05:52:57,False,,negative

fl9298i,"No it makes perfect sense. I almost died a few times as well, and when you know a dr has told your spouse/family to be prepared for you not to make it, that’s powerful. My transplant and subsequent complications were in 2010. For the next few years I was constantly sick, as I had no immune system and was an upper-elementary school teacher. By 2014 I was finally feeling better and successfully fighting off illness.   I couldn’t drink for about four years, and when I could, everything just tasted like rubbing alcohol. So instead of doing the responsible thing and not drinking alcohol, I decided to drink straight bourbon and scotch. I was blacking out for the first time in my life (at 34) and did some really risky and dangerous stuff. I ended up talking to my therapist and psychiatrist about it, and they talked to me about it and said that bc I almost died etc.. I had the fearlessness and recklessness of a teen ager. That it makes sense but I need to get a grip. I did so many crazy things that I look back on and can’t believe I put myself in dangerous situations. Also, it’s not as accepted to black out and do crazy shit when you are a 34 year old teacher, with a husband, dog, and mortgage as when you’re 18.  All of this rambling is to say that I totally understand and empathize with where you are coming from. I have retained a bit of recklessness in that I know that life and health is really a crap shoot when it comes down to it. For me, I think the fact that I was on a ventilator and did have a tube in my side that creates an especially visceral reaction. I need to stop reading the news and articles that go into depth about young people getting seriously ill. Until I read about potential shortages of ventilators it really didn’t hit me. I also need to talk to my oncologist to find out if I am high risk because I’m not sure honestly. In the meantime I’m going to lay low with my husband and dog.  Glad you pulled through.

177a7u3,"I received two shots in 2021 (Pfizer), a booster in 2022 (Moderna), and yesterday a (Spikevax) booster. 

However I have one problem.

I'm a mid-20s female with a history of irregular menstrual cycles, however, I regulate my periods by taking a progesterone only birth control pill. So my menstrual cycles are usually 3 to 4 weeks apart. My last menstrual cycle started on September 28th and lasted about 4 to 7 days.

Yesterday after receiving the booster, I started having bad cramping a few hours later. It wasn't like a normal menstrual cramp though, it was lower down in my pelvic region, and I assumed that because I had already been experiencing a stomach bug earlier in the week, perhaps the cramps were from something not settling right in my stomach and preparing to exit my body in a violent fashion. So I drank as much fluids as possible to prepare for what I thought was impending diarrhea.

However I got a surprise this morning: It wasn't diarrhea, it was menstrual blood. Not old, brown menstrual blood, but fresh red menstrual blood. Not enough to necessitate a tampon, perhaps a panty liner or a small pad at best, but it still took me by surprise as it's only been about a week to a week and a half since my last menstrual cycle ended.

I have not missed any of my birth control pills either so the only explanation I can think of is that the booster shot triggered it. 

I know that there was talk about this early on but I've not been able to find any actual discussion on it. I'm not losing crazy amounts of blood so I'm not really concerned, just more so intrigued if the COVID booster is to blame for my menstrual cycle starting a week after my last one ended.

Bit worried as at the moment I’m very mucusy and can’t get it up so i’m using my clenil but apparently the use of the steroid inhalers is working against people with the virus because although the virus causes the immune system to go into overdrive and kill virus + healthy cells, the steroids work to stop the immune response so we don’t get an attack. Apparently when it is used for 2-3 weeks during the virus it causes it to be very severe.   But they also recommend continuing it if you have it.  So I really am just not sure what I’m doing atm. If I take it i’m less immune so could catch it easier..bjt would be comfortable before I get it.

This will help cut your risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus.

Those *estimates* are bullshit, because we don't know how many mild and asymptomatic cases are out there.

As a result, the vast majority of people do not go to doctors, do not get tested, and are invisible in the medical statistics.  So the ""death rate"" estimates are grossly exaggerated, and we will see those percentages come down as more and more testing rolls out and more of these invisible minor cases are detected.  >That's TEN times less than COVID.

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, **it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data**.

It's really amazing to see all the different things I've been learning in my intro to immunology class since January comment to play on the major scientific field right now due to the pandemic. Last week in class we were supposed to learn about antibodies, but classes obviously been canceled due to the university closing for the pandemic.   Taking a look at Grandpa's HLA genes to see how he was able to obviously produce antibodies for all of these pandemics over the past 100 years would be really interesting, given with his consent of course. Taking a look at how antigen presenting cells take the virus proteins and present them to t cells which then have t cell receptors. Which have been coded for by his HLA genes, which luckily match the virus proteins being presented, would be really interesting. Perhaps with a large-scale data analysis of his HLA genome in comparing it to those of others and perhaps random people from the general population with the use of computational biology would would shed more insight on to designing antibodies for mass production in the lab.

fpsfs36,"My feeling is that the reaction to your proposal would be schools eliminating risky programs entirely, not reducing the price of those specific programs.  Just seems easier to cut the areas with low ROI than to change students' tuition depending on the program they're in.  And I don't really see how that result would benefit anybody.  What I would propose is to put legislation in place to keep state school tuition reasonable, with the cost being tied to inflation so rates don't balloon over time.    That does two things: It gives students the opportunity for a higher education without downing themselves in loans.

fw6lywa,"Absolutely there is a middle ground.  In classrooms in Japan, students are frowned upon when they express their opinions. This comes at a cost. I believe individualistic societies are more innovative. The USA has always been fractured because it is a melting pot of many cultures. This is a strength and a weakness. It is a weakness in that people get in their tribes and fight. It is a strength when you realize you can pull the best characteristics from different groups to come up with a solution. The benefits for this are usually seen longer term while the downside is seen in the short term.  Clear examples of this can be see with things like “code talkers”. This was a unusual short term benefit.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_talker  The long term gain is economic growth. Individualism ramps up economic growth and progress that pulls people out of poverty in the long run but in the short run leads to wide economic disparity. I think the pull towards collectivism has slowed the growth leading people to clash. As people have been trapped indoors thinking about their current situation, this built up anger is coming out. On the other hand the extremes of individualism in the 1800’s led to massive growth which also led to protests over economic disparity. We benefit today from that growth while the individuals at that time suffered.   So too much of a good thing is bad... It reminds me of when I added spinach to my diet and went on a healthy eating kick. My endurance performance was helped a lot. I had a good clean diet. I hate a bag of spinach every day.

Aka: HIV + SARS..  ================  Identification of Coronavirus Sequences in Carp cDNA from Wuhan, China  Journal of Medical Virology, published March 11.  If confirmed with other research, it suggests SARS-2 might be a product of genetic engineering. Bats and carp don't consort that much in nature. This is being low key censored because it would make the public go ape shit.  EDIT: to add the following excerpt  SARS-CoV-2 were identified in two separate cDNA pools. The first pool was from a Carassius auratus (crusian carp) cell line and the second was from Ctenopharyngodon idella(grass carp) head kidney tissue (6, 7)  Turns out both these samples to the database were submitted from Wuhan.  So let's examine some of the coincidences so far:  -- a new bat derived coronavirus appears in a market close to the only lab in China known to be working with bat derived corona viruses  -- the new virus has a bizarre genetic overlap with the carp genome  -- the carp genome was submitted by researchers working out of Wuhan  -- the new virus has slight but functionally important genetic similarities to HIV; not a smoking gun, but the only coronavirus with said mutation... but wait! no there is one in nature with this mutation... published Jan 20, after the outbreak started... from researchers working out of -- you guessed it -- Wuhan  I won't explicitly say it, because people get banned and censored for doing so, and more importantly, these days I am happy if I can simply get my aged mother and people like her to avoid gatherings and wear a mask.

nftp6gp,"Imma paste my previous answer to this - I get the concern considering the daily news about stuff   So I work for one of the flu manufactures in the US. We started this years manufacturing in Jan and it has proceeded much like every other year. While the changes at FDA and CDC are deeply concerning it hasn’t impacted the production. You would be getting the same quality vaccine as every other year.     Most vaccines sold in the US are sold internationally as well. And every one of those countries has their own version of the FDA. So there is no reason to change any quality practices because you still have to meet the international rules.  And don’t overlook inertia- people have been making vaccines, including Covid, using “method a” for years - it would take a lot more time for people’s ingrained habits of working to change.  And finally my plug for people - most people I encounter understand that our products are used for babies ( and other people). Babies are cute and fuzzy like puppies and kitties.

fpptcbz,"Yep. Medical school ==> Residency ==> Fellowship  Residency is different from rotating like a 3rd year student. The similarity between the two is that you interact with patients and can't practice independently.  You do both have rotations, but that's about where similarities end. A 3rd year student is a student, a resident is an employed doctor.  Your decisions as a resident doctor actually impact patient lives. A student suggests X medication, you talk about it. Patient is not getting that medication because student cannot order it.  A resident, on the other hand,  decides on a medicine/treatment, orders the medication and the patient gets it. So, the stakes are waaaaay higher as a resident. You have a supervising doctor, of course, who makes sure your decisions don't actually kill anyone.  But, as a resident you can be left alone with patients without a supervising/attending physician as long as you can get in contact with the attending. You spend residency learning how to confidently assess patients and make medical decisions on your own. At my program, residents basically manage the hospital floor and patients see the attending physician during rounds in the morning or if a patient is trying to die (if they can get there in time). A hospital can run on residents, it cannot run on 3rd year students.  3rd year of medical school is more about exposure to different medical fields and you get grades at the end of each rotation and a sense of whether you would want to apply to said residency. The rotations in residency may help you decide which fellowship to apply. Fellowship will teach you how to be a specialist.",Reddit_Comment,2020-05-06 23:45:52,False,,positive

nqmgv2,"My previous post(s): https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nd3144/33f_2nd_pfizer_dose_second_update/

It’s been a month since I got my second dose of Pfizer and, unfortunately, I’m still not better.  My husband took a week off of work to stay with me but couldn’t take any more, so now I’m staying with my parents for the time being until I’m comfortable being alone again.  Symptoms that I still have are:

-Chronic chest & middle back pain with occasional shortness of breath

-Random shooting/burning pains in my mid & upper back

-Limbs tingling/feeling of half-numbness

-Palpitations and heart pounding, high heart rate

-Poor sleep

-Brain fog and poor vision

I went to the cardiologist and wore a 5 day holter monitor and am waiting for them to call me back with any results.  Normally, trying to sleep is the worst and I usually get worsening chest pain/pounding heart when trying to sleep and then I can’t sleep.  I’ve been taking Turmeric, Fish Oil, Magnesium daily and Ibuprofen as needed and I feel like its helped a little.

I know recently there have been a lot of posts hOw Do YoU kNoW tHeSe PeOpLe ArEn’T LiArS but I’m just telling my story. And hoping people who feel the same don’t feel alone.  I’ve chatted privately with a couple of people on here and it helps to feel like you aren’t alone in your misery.  So this post is for the people who need to hear that they aren’t the only ones suffering, they aren’t going crazy.

My cardiologist says give it a few more weeks to heal and I’m just dying to go back to normal.  Praying for good health for you all!",Vaccine,2021-06-02 23:00:49,True,,negative

If it wasn't mandated I would have been better. For  me and many others less shots milder symptoms.  In 2019/2020 medical scientist advised and urged the administration to quickly manufacture vaccines based on their knowledge and it was done. Some Democrats questionned when Republicans were handling 2019/2020 pandemic so Democrats refused to take the covid vaccine and there was mistrust with it, then when Democrats were in they changed minds and all were for it and then mandated it. Why the change? Some say this should not be political issue, should be human issue.   There's many different people with various medical issues who felt they needed the vaccine and it helped them, but many like myself only were injured. Medical freedom should only be between patient and doctor, since we all have different issues for truthful, personal, sincere facts.    Doctors have proven most masks did not provide the protection we were thought to be using them for, so we all were still getting covid and other illnesses but providing herd immunity as how scientists say has been going on naturally for many years.

My questions are…
Is this an actual risk if the children have had multiple mRNAs without any issues?
Does the Novavax have this potential risk?  My understanding is that the myocarditis risk was with mRNA vaccines. Both children are older than 12 so should be eligible for Novavax. ",Vaccine,2025-02-22 13:36:41,True,,negative

tz3kmi,"28M. 9 months of epididymo-orchitis here (right testicle) - started 2 weeks after I received my 2nd dose of AstraZeneca, at the end of June 2021 (which makes me think that's a side effect of it).

Been to 2 different urologists and 3 ultrasounds. Ultrasounds showed everything looks normal, besides that I have epididymo-orchitis. Urologists did urine, semen and blood tests too - no bacteria, infections or tumour markers were found (been with the same partner for 10 years anyway). Hormone and testosterone levels are normal too. Sperm levels are extremely low, but this is likely caused by a surgery I had as a child (undescended testicles) and I've already accepted my infertility. It also never caused me any problems before the epididymitis started 9 months ago anyway.

No antibiotics were prescribed as there is no infection. They just told me to take ibuprofen when it hurts, or if it continues, they ""can try cipro"". Needless to explain, i said NO. Ibuprofen eases the pain, but it usually comes back shortly after.

Symptoms :pain comes when I sit or lay in bed for long period of times. When I am standing or walking the pain is non-existent. Epididymitis is thick , as well as the bottom of my right testicle (feels like the surface is harsh and I often get sharp 1-2 seconds of very bad pain there, accompanied with itching too). After ejaculation, the pain is briefly relieved, but then it starts again on the next day.

Or in other words, self-centeredness at the minimum.  It's scary because similar cases have happened, to less or more severity in other countries.  In China, there were reports of people purposely coughing in front of people in a Wuhan hospital (not sure whether they have COVID-19).  In Singapore, there was a spitting on lift buttons and teenagers playing a prank by filming one of them drinking a bottle and putting the bottle back to the shelves.

otznqp,"I am a healthy 29 year old female who has never had a panic attack in my life, I have struggled with mild anxiety but that is about it.  I got my first dose of Pfizer in early March I was not nervous to get the vaccine at all in fact I was excited to feel protected and get back to some sort of normal.  I got my shot and sat for the 15mins and was fine left and went to get something to eat.  As soon as I sat down a panic attack hit me like a ton of bricks.  Since I’ve never had one I was confused as to what was happening but I was having trouble breathing, racing thoughts, getting very hot it almost felt like an out of body experience.  I needed to leave the restaurant and it lasted about 2 hours but I thought maybe it was just a very overwhelming experience and that’s how I reacted to it. 

Fast forward and the panic attacks persisted EVERY SINGLE DAY.  I went to countless doctors who told me that is not a possible reaction caused by the vaccine but I refuse to believe I developed a debilitating panic disorder overnight out of nowhere.  I know myself and my body and I have never experienced anything like this before.  I met with a doctor who finally told me he believed me and I felt like I could cry he said I should think long and hard before getting the second shot. I decided to get it because after all I went through I might as well be fully protected. That was another horrible experience getting the second shot but I did it and all the doctors there could say was you we’re probably just nervous to get the shot, which I was not.

I now need to be medicated to deal with life which is something I have never experienced and even that was hell trying to find an appropriate medication that would help me. Some did nothing some made the panic attacks worse.  I went about a month with no panic attacks and decided to try and come off the medication because I thought maybe it was getting better.  We’ll the panic attack as are starting to come back again.  Nowhere near what they were but still nowhere near my normal self prior to being vaccinated.  I just want to feel normal!!

I met a doctor recently who told me that is an effect of the vaccine and the good news is it will go away it could take weeks it could take months but I need answers! I reported my side effects to everyone I could and have not heard anything back since I reported months ago.  I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar situation and found something that helped them! I am in therapy and have been for years and now see a psychiatrist due to the fact that I need medication I just feel so out of control of my own body, things that I loved to do now terrify me for fear that I will have a panic attack.",Vaccine,2021-07-30 00:27:03,True,,negative
