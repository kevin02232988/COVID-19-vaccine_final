Starting in September hair loss seems significantly slowed down. That was 4 months past the vaccine. The good news is the hair seems to start to regrow though in my case it will be at least 4 or 5 years before it has its original length again. The bad news is that by now there is such severe damage done with more than 90% of hair lost that I may never recover and there are no legal means at least at this present time to hold those who have caused that accountable.

Up to this point I’ve had all Moderna shots (initial series and two boosters, last one being the Omicron booster last fall, which I also got with the flu shot).  For this new booster I had to get Pfizer due to availability issues.  Got it yesterday at 8:30 AM and I’m feeling almost completely normal 24 hours later.  I did have fatigue, some achiness and chills yesterday afternoon starting around 3 PM and lasting through most of the night but it was all soooo mild compared to my last booster experience.  I was so miserable for almost 3 days last time - even with ibuprofen and Tylenol.  Every Moderna shot I’ve had, except for the very first one, I’ve had these covid-like reactions to them that just sink me.  This year- hardly at all!  It’s so weird!

"**Abstract** Vaccines have been central in ending the COVID-19 pandemic, but newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants increasingly escape first-generation vaccine protection. To fill this gap, live particle-based vaccines mimicking natural infection aim at protecting against a broader spectrum of virus variants.  We designed “single-cycle SARS-CoV-2 viruses” (SCVs) that lack essential viral genes, possess superior immune-modulatory features and provide an excellent safety profile in the Syrian hamster model. Full protection of all intranasally vaccinated animals was achieved against an autologous challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus using an Envelope-gene-deleted vaccine candidate. By deleting key immune-downregulating genes, sterilizing immunity was achieved with an advanced candidate without virus spread to contact animals. Hence, SCVs have the potential to induce a broad and durable protection against COVID-19 superior to a natural infection.",2023-05-23 2:48

They’re expecting 40-80% of the population to contract the virus. You have to also factor in that the flu typically dies out in warmer weather and is only common in the winter months.

If you’re looking at 100-250+ million people with the virus then that 1.5-3% mortality rate looks a lot worse. You’re looking at millions of deaths.

And it would not be a bad idea to look back at that and establish how many those were exactly. Maybe those numbers could help prevent future death, maybe the investigation would find that it's suck cosmic bad luck that there is nothing to be done preventatively.   It would be good to have data that could be compared to other vaccines, like is the myocarditis thing something that happens more with MRNA vaccines or less than with something like the traditional flu shot?    That said, I have no confidence in the current FDA to produce anything remotely useful in this investigation...",2025-09-13 6:34

"I'm starting to wonder if this is vaccine related. After my first dose of Pfizer I has strange colorful visions before my eyes in a darkened room. It was very bright with motion. Looked like my vision was filled with small brightly colored squirming worms. It went away after a couple days. This was over 1 year ago.

Due to a problem with my arm I delayed my second dose to about 42 days. I got it and the same thing happened with my vision and the brightly colored squirming worms. It didn't affect my vision in the daylight or with lights on. I could only see it in the dark. But then something else happened. My left eye started getting stabbing pains, like in the eyeball itself not on the surface of the eye. I also started having some pain in my right eye as well. This is like deep aching pain and pain when I move my eyes.

Eventually it toned down and the weird visions went away as well. My partner and I had got vaccinated at the same time and so I described this issue with my eyes to him an he told me he had the same thing. Not the pain but the strange visual effects when closing his eyes at night or looking out into the dark. 

Well time went on to about 7 months after my second dose and everyone was saying we should get a booster. Due to the problems with my arms and the concern about the pain in my eyes I was very hesitant about a booster but I was nervous about COVID too since I'm older and have high risk conditions. So I got my booster and...nothing. There was no pain in my eyes and there was no strange visions. Just arm pain which eventually went away.

Well now it's 5 months later and for a while now I've had nearly constant pain in both my eyes as well as off and on of the strange visions. In addition to that and developing along at the same time I have had MASSIVE problems in my nose. Now I have allergies so I've always had problems with stuff sinuses and snott constantly running down my throat. It's just the nature of things with allwrgies, bit I have never in my life had constant sores inside my nose that bleed and won't heal.

I've also spent years of my life in my work looking at screens, and while my eyes do get tired at times they have never had this kind of pain and it's the same pain I had less than 24 hours after Pfizer 2. It became so bad I couldn't work or read. I went to an Opthalmologist to check my eyes and he told me he couldn't see anything wrong with them and suggested I must have a sinus infection.

Well I really doubt that. I have always had sinus problems because of the allergies and have never before had this kind of eye pain. To this day they are still in pain and I'm so frustrated with the sores in my nose that I've never had before. 

A couple weeks ago in desperation I started searching around online about what could be causing sores that won't heal inside the nose and deep eye soreness and pain. One answer I came across was HIV. And I thought...didn't I read something back in 2020 that SARSCoV2 has something in common with HIV? 

Well just today I was reading that it's some genetic code that's on the spike protein that allows cov2 to enter tcells. I mean this stuff is way over my head but all I know is that apparently it's also in the vaccines. And if HIV can cause sores that won't heal in the nose plus pain in the eyes then what has this vaccine done to my eyes and nose?

Of course I have no proof of any of this all I know is I've lived MANY years with allergies and sinus problems and nothing like this. My nose is on fire and I have trouble reading due to pain in my eyes. 

I should also mention that Ivery likely had covid in March 2020 bit was unable to get a test at that time so no proof of that either. 

One thing I'm worried about is if I do catch covid what will it do to my nose? Like I've already got something eating holes in my nose. And for the anti maskers no it's not because of wearing masks. I have wore masks in my woodshop for hours at a time, for many years and never had a problem with them. 

Does any of this sound like issues any of you have had with your eyes and or nose. I don't think it's a sinus infection and since when would a sinus infection eat holes in the nose!?",2022-04-18 9:56

"Insurance companies and schools and bureaucracies shouldn't be making things like this difficult. If there are alterations that need to be made for medical reasons as dictated by a licensed physician, what business does anyone else have trying to stand in a doctor or families way of doing what's right for the child in these scenarios?   In the case of the TDap, I couldn't have the combo but I got the tetanus and diphtheria shots separately (which the insurance also made a stink about because why pay for 2 shots when there's a one shot combo?) but something about specifically the pertussis component of the TDap was the problem so when it came to pertussis, I was one of the kids who needed my classmates and teachers to be vaccinated for it if they could be since I could not.   The school however, threw a fit over it. It was back and forth between my pediatrician, the school nurse, and the principal for about a month every summer trying to make these people understand that for me at least, the risks outweighed the benefits (pretty sure they thought he was an anti-vax quack, which considering he was the one also fighting to get insurance to cover the two separate shots and the pneumonia vaccine is laughable)   And in the case of pneumonia, at the time (apparently this is now changed which is good to hear) but back then, it wasn't standard for children so since I was the vulnerable one the decision was made to give me the vaccine. Side note, 3 years ago when I went to the pharmacy to get the flu shot, COVID vaccine, and prevnar 21, I had to argue with the pharmacist about the prevnar for an hour. ""You're in your 20s, you don't need that"" Well, here's my full immunization record showing I have had the childhood version, here's some of the paperwork from the hospital the 3 times I had the illness itself, and here's proof of the birth defects that put me in the high risk group for complications. ""None of this proves anything"" the hell it does.   The problem isn't that there's a general guide line, the problem is that so many people in the different facets of this are so wed to it that when there's an outlier that outlier and their medical team and support system have to fight like hell to get them what they need and protect them from what could hurt them because they take the baseline recommendations that apply to most as gospel for everyone.

"Hello, I would like some advice.

I received 5 doses of rabies vaccine in 2023, and then I received 2 booster doses on May 2, 2024.

Yesterday, I had a Category 2 exposure (not a deep bite, possibly a light scratch through my pants). Now it has been about 3 to 4 days since exposure.

I went to a local clinic in Myanmar, and the doctor there told me I need to restart the full 5-dose vaccine series again, even after I explained my full vaccine history.

But I have read that:

WHO and CDC say people who already had a full series do not need to restart the full series after exposure.

Only 2 booster doses (Day 0 and Day 3) are needed after re-exposure — even years later.

My booster on May 2, 2024 is still very recent (just 1year and 2 months ago), so I should already be protected.


I’m very poor and rabies vaccines are expensive in Myanmar. I want to understand:

1. Is the full vaccine series really needed again in my case?


2. How long does a rabies booster protect someone?


3. Is it too late to get vaccinated now (Day 3-4)?


4. Am I still protected from my May booster?



Thank you. I have already read the WHO FAQ and I’m trying to do the right thing.

"Got my COVID booster yesterday (Thursday) after work. The arm pain didn't start at all for like 4-5 hours, which I thought was weird and slow. Middle of the night and next morning arm pain is pretty bad. I haven't really noticed other symptoms - usually I get pretty bad headaches. My dreams were vivid?

Anyway, I left the bandaid on and notice that it's really high on my arm. Not in the beefiest part of my muscle. Only about one finger below the acromion.

How worried about it's effectiveness would you be if you were me? 

I would prefer answers supported by evidence. I found standard nursing vacation IM administration guidelines, and those recommend at least two fingers below the acromion and above the armpit.

Update:
He knew exactly where it was: it was bleeding. I took the bandaid off this morning and there's a small bruise at the site.

Glad to hear effectiveness shouldn't be an issue. I was worried since my overall immune reaction seemed less than other COVID shots I've gotten.

Fortunately, he missed the shoulder capsule - I think/hope - though he got pretty damn close.

Shoulder pain is basically non-existent. I went climbing yesterday with it and nothing bad happened.

So, end result: it was fine. He DID go high. That may have made it more painful than normal.
The vaccine-arm pain wasn't my concern: my concern was that it took so long to start and the lack of other symptoms. And it being objectively not where it was supposed to be.

Then the second day, ""Well its a big deal, but will magically disappear"".  Then, ""It's just like a moderately bad case of the flu...nothing to worry about"".   Then, ""I wash my hands of this, up to the governors"".  Then ""Why aren't you opening?!"".  Then ""Liberate your state!"".  Then ""I don't think masks really work, but if you want to wear one.""

I saw recently two cashiers wearing their masks this way and yesterday I was visiting a zoo and there was a mask wearing obligation for the queue at the entrance and again two women were there wearing their masks wrong. It is just so stupid. Why not wear the mask properly? Especially the people in the queue at the zoo only had to wear it for about 5 minutes.

"Quite frankly, as an American, I'm quite sad at how the USA has handled this situation in all respects. In situations like this I guess I was naively thinking/hoping that everyone could put aside their differences and collectively do what it takes to contain this thing.  Especially from a leadership point of view. Yes there are many citizens that didn't believe the reality of the situation and only acted in a selfish way. But it starts with strong leadership at the top all the way down.  I was shocked by the decisions made by POTUS and many state governors as well as local authorities, acting like this whole thing was a hoax, or downplaying it as much as they were.  Respect of your government is what keeps people in solidarity and acting collectively to do what it takes for the betterment of the nation. Clearly we don't have any respect, and for good reason. Those that claim oppression by being asked to wear masks is annoying and a clear indication of people that don't have an understanding of what our freedoms mean.

"# **Abstract**  > *Myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), long COVID (LC) and post-COVID-19 vaccine syndrome show similarities in their pathophysiology and clinical manifestations. These disorders are related to viral or adjuvant persistence, immunological alterations, autoimmune diseases and hormonal imbalances.*   > *A developmental model is postulated that involves the interaction between immune hyperactivation, autoimmune hypophysitis or pituitary hypophysitis, and immune depletion. This process might begin with a deficient CD4 T-cell response to viral infections in genetically predisposed individuals (HLA-DRB1), followed by an uncontrolled immune response with CD8 T-cell hyperactivation and elevated antibody production, some of which may be directed against autoantigens, which can trigger autoimmune hypophysitis or direct damage to the pituitary, resulting in decreased production of pituitary hormones, such as ACTH.*   > *As the disease progresses, prolonged exposure to viral antigens can lead to exhaustion of the immune system, exacerbating symptoms and pathology. It is suggested that these disorders could be included in the autoimmune/adjuvant-induced inflammatory syndrome (ASIA) because of their similar clinical manifestations and possible relationship to genetic factors, such as polymorphisms in the HLA-DRB1 gene. In addition, it is proposed that treatment with antivirals, corticosteroids/ginseng, antioxidants, and metabolic precursors could improve symptoms by modulating the immune response, pituitary function, inflammation and oxidative stress.*   > ***Therefore, the purpose of this review is to suggest a possible autoimmune origin against the adenohypophysis and a possible improvement of symptoms after treatment with corticosteroid replacement therapy.***  # **Keywords**  *myalgic encephalomyelitis, long COVID, post-COVID-19 vaccine syndrome, ASIA syndrome, EBV, SARS-CoV-2, HLA-II, hypophysitis*",2024-08-23 16:18

"The response to this virus tells you *so much* about the culture of a nation.

It's just that it's a little more controlled -- which can mean the difference between life and death for a lot of folks.  I don't think the US is a culture that can be locked down, at all. I doubt democrats would have done much better. There is just too fierce a streak of the individualist, my-freedom-at-all-costs sort of mindset.

I asked the physician if the nurse could draw the vaccine in the office so I could confirm that the correct vaccine was given, along with checking the expiration date. The physician took it personally and told me that if I didn’t trust the office, then I should not be their patient. The nurse, on the other hand, didn’t have any problems with this request and showed me the vial. The reason I initially asked the doctor and not the nurse was because I would not see the nurse until she was ready to administer shots. 

I am an RN, but I left nursing a while ago. I was working on the ICU floor, but I would occasionally float to pediatrics, and there were times when parents requested that I show them what medications were administered or verify insulin dosage. I never had an issue with them and always complied with the request, understanding that there is a human factor and that errors, unfortunately, happen to the best of us.

I have bad anxiety when it comes to vaccines and their potential side effects (tinnitus, neurological problems, etc.) I've concluded that the ones that should be considered are vaccines for rabies, hep B, and Japanese Encephalitis. I understand that the potential benefits outweigh any potential side effects that these shots may come with, but I'm still reluctant to get them due to my fear of the ""what if"".

"Does anyone have any insight on the risk of receiving the JYNNEOS smallpox/monkeypox vaccine close to the mRNA COVID vaccines?

Where I live (Washington DC) I am eligible for the JYNNEOS shot and I got my first dose of the vaccine yesterday. I was reading the VIS sheet last night, and it indicates that adolescent/young adult males should consider to wait 4 weeks before getting an mRNA vaccine due to the risk of myocarditis. I did some quick research into it, and it seems that the warning is simply because there is a documented risk of myocarditis between the mRNA vaccines and ACAM2000 (a different type of smallpox vaccine administered with a bifurcated needle) and the risk with JYNNEOS is currently unknown.

I didn't realize that the JYNNEOS was a two-part vaccine, and my second shot is scheduled for 17 August. If the CDC were to theoretically authorize a second booster for those <50 years soon, would there be an official guidance to wait until say early October to mitigate risk? I'm 27 and was vaccinated + boosted with Moderna if it matters, and most data shows that the risk is highest in 16-24 y/o males.",2022-07-22 0:47

"I am not sure how old you are, but I am late 20s- (Female), no children yet, had covid a month ago. My personal biggest concern (and only impacting those of child bearing age groups) is that there are no significant and long term studies which promise there to be no impact on fertility (in both Male/ Female), instead I see concerning data regarding the spike proteins in the vaccines gathering in ovaries and testes. Whether these specific claims are true or not (I am no scientist), the severe censorship of any opposing science to the mainstream ideology of the vaccine programme raise huge red flags for me. And the absolute fact of the matter is, these vaccines are still in experimental stages. In addition, the fact that no one is exploring treatment rather than pushing ineffective (non sterilising, as can be seen in recent data from uk and Israel) vaccines are another concern- if the agenda was to save lives, this should surely be the first route. Additionally the complete disregard for previous infection which many scientific journals have proved incite immunity (apparently stronger than the vaccine/ immunity to all variants). Your decision is entirely your own, and I respect anyone’s wish to either take the vax or not, although it seems my body is no longer my own to govern. I guess my biggest advice to you would be to consider how historically censorship has been used to control behaviour and drive an agenda. I would be much more inclined to take this Vaccine if there had been an open and honest conversation allowed, rather than the unvacced becoming shunned with increasingly diminished freedoms.

"Hi, I hope this is an appropriate place to ask a question regarding the rabies vaccine.
I am travelling from Europe to Indonesia next month and thought I'd be an adult for once and get the appropriate vaccines.
My new gp went through the list with me and we settled on, among others, the rabies vaccine (Rabipur).


While waiting for them to be ready to give me the shot, I read up on the vaccine out of boredom, and was surprised to find that the prep recommendation is a 3 shot regimen with a dose on day 0, day 7 and day 21/28 (and additional shots after you are actually exposed, i.e. bitten by an animal). Some sources claim this was updated in 2018 to be 2 shots only, but every site I read speaks definitively of multiple shots. I don't recall ever having had any as a child, but would definitely need the full set either way.


I had a prescription for only 1 shot, the doctor's assistant was not clear on the advice, and when I asked the gp herself, she waved me off and said ""we only ever administer one shot for this, it's completely normal.""


Can I trust this advice, or should I seek another medical opinion? I am uneasy, since the Internet very strongly disagrees with this take. Would appreciate any input, given the next shot would have to be next week (and I would need to find a new physician in the very short term to get it done on time).

"The FDA and the CDC are separate entities even though they both fall under the umbrella of the Department of Health and Human Services. While both are supposed to protect and promote community health, they do it in different ways. The FDA regulates the quality of our food and medicine, determining what is safe to give to people in general. The CDC issues recommendations to doctors and insurers about what the best practices are when administering the FDA-approved medicines, procedures, etc. So in this case, the FDA is saying the Moderna Covid vaccine is approved for use in children, but the CDC is saying that doctors still shouldn’t give it to children (giving insurance an excuse not to cover the vaccine) unless it is a case of “high risk”.   The CDC recommendations really don’t make sense, but there is a strong political tinge there. There’s a long issue of having to make CDC recommendations palatable to the administration in charge. Don’t get me started on the whole issue regarding things like masturbation, condoms, etc. all of which hit political live wires and made the CDC give recommendations that didn’t quite match what the science was saying.",2025-07-10 14:07

When asked to help make more he said ""why? no need"", then he later said he would help, then he bought extra from a stockpile.

Musk had seem to be planning to wait until it's too late and people are dying in droves before he actually makes some ventilators.  These ventilators he is giving away were just a means to appease the people begging him to help make new ones. Instead of taking the request seriously he bought some to give away, but what we need from him is producing new ones, not reshuffling a warehouse stock of existing ones.

Now, I do get the novavax- I feel better w an older technology bc I do think mRNA hasn’t been around long enough for studies.

"Hi everyone,

I could really use some advice.

I (23F) got my **first dose of Gardasil 9 on May 15**. I was planning to get my **second dose on July 15** and the **third dose on November 15**, but honestly, I’m not sure if I can afford all 3 doses right now since in my country we have to pay for the HPV vaccine ourselves.

I’ve seen different recommendations from health authorities about 1, 2, or 3-dose schedules, and it’s confusing. I’ve read that WHO and some studies say a single dose can be effective, while other guidelines still recommend 3 doses, especially for older age groups.

Given that I’m 23 and started the vaccine at this age:

* Is **1 dose enough** for me?
* Would **2 doses be protective**, or is it not sufficient at my age?
* Do I really need all **3 doses** to get proper protection?

I really want to protect myself against HPV, but the financial side is tough. Any insights from people who’ve been in a similar situation, or any healthcare professionals here, would be so appreciated.

Thank you!",2025-07-10 21:34
"I don't WANT to get into some heated debate with you about this but I'd like to give you a little insight on those of us who have ""little Reddit history""...in my particular case, and I'm sure many others, we go looking for answers when something is bothering us.

In my experience, ESPECIALLY with anything to do with this vaccine, when I google questions or concerns I have about, or I'm looking for those who have had a similar experience, I'm often LED to sub-Reddit posts about the vaccine. I begin reading the posts and maybe I find one I want to respond to, so some of us need to create an account or activate an existing one we seldom use because we don't visit Reddit often but have used it sporadically.

""It is therefore important to take into consideration that such non-specific effects, and their immunological basis, have been established for several other vaccines.2,21 Non-specific effects of vaccines have been observed to differ between live-attenuated vaccines and non-live vaccines; live vaccines have been associated with reduced all-cause mortality while this has not been seen for non-live vaccines.2 For example, RCTs have shown that Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis reduces neonatal mortality by more than a third,22,23 due to protection against deaths from sepsis and respiratory infections. In parallel, immunological studies have provided a mechanism by showing that BCG induces “trained immunity” leading to enhanced resistance toward a broad range of pathogens.""",2023-05-10 6:45

"Then you're letting this virus control your life and that's just as dumb as not using a mask, washing your hands etc. Let's be perfectly clear here, there is a risk of death with Covid, but that risk is very small. First there is a very small risk that it actually spreads, and then there is a very small risk that anyone will actually die. The reason we hear about these things is because they're rare and therefore news worthy.   In Sweden, the death rate for people aged 0-69 with a confirmed covid-19 infection is 0.1%. In reality that will be even lower since there will be plenty of recoveries in people that were never tested. Then if you're in the 0-40 age range it's going to be even lower than that. Then you need to multiply that by the risk of getting infected, which quite frankly isn't very big at all since the people you're meeting probably don't have covid.

I'm not trying to hold him to some standard where it would be impossible to get credit for anything and in my prior post I highlighted some areas where I believe he could have demonstrated a serious commitment through his own personal actions and words.

"> It's almost certain he might not have contracted it at all and if he did it would have been mild.  No. Masks are like seatbelts. They help, a lot, but wearing a seatbelt is not a guarantee you won't be seriously injured or killed in an accident.  And you can't just do whatever you want while wearing a seatbelt either-- going to a massive rally is somewhat akin to going 140mph down a highway. Whether you're wearing your seatbelt is not really the top issue, the top issue is that you shouldn't be driving so recklessly in the first place.",2020-07-30 15:39

"That’s so scary :(   It just seems odd to me that everyone that’s been denied a test has been given different excuses or criteria they have to meet. I would think everyone would be on the same page regarding what qualifies someone to be tested. It makes sense that knowing who is sick would help with containment because the health authority could see who the sick person had been in contact with and then test those people or tell them to self quarantine. If people don’t know they’re sick or have come into direct contact with an infected person then they could still be going out to public places and exposing countless others. I don’t know, at the end of the day I’m not educated about these types of things so what do I know. It just seems counterproductive to limiting how quickly the virus is spread.   I am really sorry about your mom though. I just had a baby early and they sent us home after just a week in the hospital so I understand your fear. Bringing a premie home during all of this is the last thing I wanted to do. Did your sister tell the doctor about your mom? I guess they would tell her to self quarantine regardless of the test results but it would still be nice to have that peace of mind, especially because we don’t know how long we are contagious before becoming symptomatic. Can your mom try and get tested since she does have a pre-existing condition? She would probably be told that since she hasn’t had direct contact with an infected person that she doesn’t need to be tested. It’s just a nightmare.

"To preface, I worked as an RN in the ICU during COVID and was begging everyone I knew to get vaccinated. I interacted with many unvaccinated patients who died from COVID, and very willingly got all three vaccinations, all from Pfizer. I am not blowing any whistles, just seeking info from all angles to figure out what’s been going on with me.

Since 10/2021, the month I received my third booster, I have had abnormal and intensely painful periods. These begin with spotting, then a few days of nothing, and then 7-8 days of full and particularly heavy flow, with a total of around 11 days of bleeding. During the first two days of full flow, I have debilitating low abdominal, low back, hip, thigh, and knee pain. I feel feverish and cannot get warm, I am very fatigued, and have intense brain fog. During this time, I cannot do anything but lay down. Ibuprofen will help with pain, but it usually takes 2-3 hours to have an effect, and then I must take it every 3.5 hours.

I took meloxicam (anti-inflammatory used typically for arthritis or other joint pain) for a short stint in 2023, during which I had normal periods with virtually no pain.

In January of 2024, I started taking supplements to boost progesterone, as most of the issues I am dealing with these days could be linked to an abundance of estrogen. I now have slightly shorter cycles, a little less pain, less fatigue and brain fog, less bleeding, and no feverishness.

A few other things that happened prior to my cycle changes could have increased my estrogen levels, and I’ve also since discovered I have a gene mutation that affects my ability to process estrogen and B vitamins. In the spring of 2021 I took estrogen based birth control for the first time. I also used plan B, an estrogen based medication, in August 2021.

It seems like a perfect storm that led me to have an imbalance of estrogen and progesterone. I don’t know if the vaccine had anything to do with this, but I am aware that it affected a large number of women’s cycles immediately after vaccination, but these changes were not recorded as being long term. I’m interested to hear from anyone who knows about the mechanism of action that led to these brief cycle changes for other women.

Of note, I have been dealing with chronic pain and inflammation since summer 2023. Also, I only had Covid once in June 2022.

Has anybody else experienced similar changes around the time of vaccination that have not gone away? I’m just trying to get to the bottom of what happened and what continues to go on in my body, and our US healthcare system is often woefully incapable of helping women with issues related to menstruation.

"Why wouldn't letting the healthy get it stop the spread? In absolute numbers, the cases will go up, sure.  But the real fear is the vulnerable.

Regardless, even if that were not true, locking down a population has huge economic and personal costs. If the only objective is stopping COVID, then sure, ignore those costs and lockdown.  Because we don't live in a world where we can ignore that, we have to consider where we are taking from the economy to help the public health. I think that letting people balance the risks themselves is the best way to find that out.  I view it very similar to driving in a snow storm.

"At my last job at a for profit urgent care chain, I was doing this already.  I would fill out workmans comp paperwork for any patient who was an essential healthcare worker with confirmed contact with COVID+ patients who developed COVID themselves.  Our employer services department was ripshit because it meant the workmans comp insurance would have to pay for the inpatient hospitalization for transfers and have to report that their EMTs who weren't issued N95s were all coming down with work related COVID.  The average person doesn't realize how much downward pressure there is to look the other way or walk on eggshells to prevent injuries from becoming reportable work related injuries.  For example, would get pressured to just steri strip lacerations deep to the subcutaneous fat because sutures makes it an OSHA reportable injury.  We would get told to not debride burns so they wouldn't be OSHA reportable injuries.  Splints with metal braces in them require OSHA reporting but soft over-the-counter  wrist braces that you can get from Walgreens for $6 dont so my last employer removed all the effective  braces to pressure us into giving the shitty soft braces with no support to side step the OSHA reporting requirements.  I would just write them a prescription to get the brace from a medical supplies pharmacy.    Its crazy to me that you getting poison ivy on the job is considered work related and receives no pushback, but you working around COVID+ patients and developing COVID isn't and gets a tremendous amount of pushback.  There was a tremendous amount of pressure for us to just conclude ""well who is to say where the healthcare worker working 70 hrs a week providing direct patient care to confirmed COVID+ patients contracted COVID from.""  Its one the reasons I certainly don't miss for profit urgent care.  I used to get told that our job was to keep the employers who sent their workers to us happy.  No it isn't.

"Hi All,

First time poster, but a comment thread recently was super kind and helpful, so, here I am.

Because of certain scheduling things and upcoming travel I'm thinking about getting the flu shot early (as in today or tomorrow), and I'm wondering a couple of things. Tomorrow at 10 AM I have a dental cleaning (I have to get them every four months), not as bad as root planing but even maintenance ones can be intense and they sometimes I think use a kind of Ozone spray, if that affects anything.

Anyway, given the exposure to actual illnesses risks of going to the dentist, and that vaccines can make one feel run down, here are my questions:

1. Would getting the shot this afternoon be a terrible idea (sometime within the next five hours), given having to teach tonight and tomorrow morning's appointment? Not sure I can even schedule this.

2. Would getting the shot tomorrow early afternoon, after the dental cleaning, work better? I'm not sure immune system wise in what order to pile on, i.e. shot night before and cleaning after, or, shot hours after cleaning.

3. I'd rather not wait until Wednesday for the vaccine, but, would that be the actual best option?

4. Given everything *gestures broadly* this year's shot is still considered okay? I'm being repetitive, I've seen this question already asked on this forum, but I'm uneasy about whatever changes that may be being made that have nothing to do with health or science. I've seen comments to the effect of that next year's vaccines will be what's affected as opposed to this year's.

Thank you so much for reading and for any guidance ❤️",2025-08-19 4:09

Hospitals are now turning people away sometimes because their symptoms don't warrant concern. They're having to do this because so many people are concerned about this coronavirus. Someone has a runny nose, and he/she thinks it's covid-19 when it's only allergies. I'll agree to disagree with you. I don't think this approach was appropriate or necessary.

"Ok I get what your referring to, but the massive increases in reproductive organs, larger intestines and Bone Marrow, are not explored further outside of the testing on the Rats and test tube testing.   Although a human liver is tested on, there is no drop off indicated with the higher dosage.    I might be missing something, that is obvious to you and I apologise if thats the case.    Currently I am trying to understand, a pattern, why CBD oil with 0.01mg THC per 10mg CBD oil appears to treat covid.  By trying to understand when a blood clot isn’t a blood clot.  Which I think I can explain by looking at the quirky aspects of the Covid infection, in how the Virus initially affects the blood in the body, and infecting the blood producers, in this case the Bone marrow, causing the blood to appear thick.   But whats causing the lowering of B12 levels in the body and other characteristics of the infection.   So I drew up a long list of the known effects in the body from covid and isolated about a dozen areas that could be affected solely by assuming the “trust the science” arguments that its just blood clotting is true.    But that doesn’t explain away all the possible causes, as 20 days before my infection, I was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism (Blood clot), and whilst the result is similar, causing blood clotting effects, including the Acute Respiratory distress / Inflammatory storms in my lungs restricting my breathing.    Plus turning my blood into a thicker blood, indicating a serious complication, other things did not make any sense.  Sure because I am not in the medical field, but also after trying to understand the problem better, with my knew knowledge from seeing the effects of CBD on my own infection.    A blood clot whilst being a convenient explanation, doesn’t fit, the evidence and symptoms being caused.    However whilst its something I had never heard of happening in the vast amount of books journals and papers I read, I knew that gelling agents existed and had seen the way jelly behaves in certain tempratures, close to that of body temperature.   So I explored that theory further, as because of all the other explanations I could find, all the others only explained away a few things.  But the jellying of the blood, explained away all besides the reproductive organs, where I myself experienced erectile dysfunction and infertility issues.    But as I experimented with a ever increasing dose of CBD, the erectile dysfunction reduced and whilst difficult it improved in function, but seaman production seems not to be happening.    So whilst my best guess was that the CBD oil could be binding to the ACE 2 blocking the spike receptors function, I cant prove this, but looking at the evidence I found, trying again to find another explanation, all roads seemed to return back to the CBD being an effective treatment.    My worry currently from reading the FOI document, is firstly that the vaccine, leaves the arm, within 6 days, and infects the body, in a way that the public information, states is impossible that it would drift, but in this FOI document, its obvious that it has drifted.  With the claim without additional information supporting the claim absent from the report.    I may be an amateur climate scientist, and not in the medical community, but I am seeing a lot of answers being given without a y working out, with no explanation to support the papers and like even this report infers its fully safe, disappearing after 6 days from the point of insertion after 6 / 9 days, but where is the detailed breakdown for the concentrations in the body?",2021-06-27 20:38

It instructs your cells to manufacture spike and your immune system teaches itself to destroy the spike that the vaccine has instructed your cells to produce. This process isn’t gone in a matter of hours. There is no known time it takes for the body to stop making spike. The Yale study called ‘Immunological and Antigenic Signatures Associated with Chronic Illnesses after COVID-19 Vaccination’ found a participant still producing spike 709 days after last vaccination. The spike protein is toxic and it’s been found all over the bodies of vaccinated individuals including brain, ovaries, testes, liver, heart etc. The spike protein has been found in tumors of cancer patients. The mRNA used is coated in lipid nano particles which are themselves potentially toxic and inflammatory and this coating prevents the mRNA from breaking down rapidly as natural mRNA would. It doesn’t “stay in your arm” and break down rapidly as was originally claimed. Empirical evidence such as the findings of Yale study prove what I’m saying is true.",2025-07-26 22:49

China did it when they needed more supplies, they raided a lot of countries for supplies in january and february.

The body develops antibodies once the virus enters the body. What is going on right now?! Why all this panic now when we didn't see it in years past for viruses with higher death rates that were just as contagious?   This virus passes like other coronaviruses...through saliva. So, if you're worried, stay a few feet away from someone who's sneezing or coughing, and wash your hand frequently. Avoid touching your face. If you're really worried, spray some lysol on the objects of yours that have passed hands. If you get sick, then take tylenol to control the fever and drink plenty of fluids.

"Hey everyone, I (F24) was raised by anti-vax parents. They were well-intentioned and while I strongly disagree with them, I know they were doing what they thought was right. However, I also know that the misinformation they were crediting as “medical research” was obviously incredibly misled and am somewhat concerned about my health as an adult. 

Am I able to receive all the vaccines I never got as a child as an adult? Are there certain vaccines I should prioritize? I did get both COVID shots plus the booster as well as one flu shot, but so far that is all I have ever received. 

I am extremely worried about my vulnerability to diseases. I am healthy, no chronic health issues besides mild asthma and some gastrointestinal sensitivities. However, I have gotten some extreme sicknesses in the last decade or so (rare, but they have happened) that probably would have only been a bad flu if not for my body being at a low defense level due to a lack of vaccines. For example, I got a flu when I was 17 that resulted in multiple days of dangerously high fever, extreme dehydration, convulsions, etc. Again, this has only happened about three times in 10 years, but I am acutely aware that that is not even remotely normal in the modern age for a regular flu in a healthy young body. I am not a doctor and have no idea how any of this works, but the concern is there.

Doctors are the quarterbacks, nurse aides are running backs, nurses are wide receivers, respiratory therapists are your tight ends, and everyone else make up the line. It does not function without every piece.   This problem about forgetting people who work in healthcare is not unique to the public. Nurses are some of the worst offenders (though everyone forgets done). They put themselves up on a pedestal while depending on every ancillary department and don't help to incorporate the rest of the disciplines into their group. Nurses get to negotiate for themselves for better pay while lab, respiratory, radiology etc get passed on.   When your loved one comes in with respiratory distress the order it in which people get seen by each specific discipline is as follows (obviously not like this every single time especially depending on severity): paramedics and EMTs pick up the patient in the home to come to the hospital. Nurse, aid, and respiratory therapist waiting for patient to arrive for immediate care and transition from EMT and paramedic. lab and radiology soon to follow so that we can have some information on how to treat the patient. Doctor in to manage case and perform invasive procedures if required.   admissions is in there to start getting paperwork and start the process of contacting family if no one is known. Depending on the case social work and chaplains may currently be involved. Now that the patient's stable and we moved from ER to inpatient.

"Sixth monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine elicits robust immune response against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in heart transplant recipients ___    Abstract - (March 22, 2024)   Continued circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has driven the selection of variants with improved ability to escape pre-existing vaccine-induced responses, posing a persistent threat to heart transplant recipients (HTRs). The immunogenicity and safety of the updated XBB.1.5-containing monovalent vaccines are unknown. We prospectively enrolled 52 HTRs who had previously received a 5-dose ancestral-derived monovalent and bivalent mRNA vaccination schedule to receive the monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine. Immunogenicity was evaluated using live virus micro-neutralization assays. The XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine elicited potent and diverse neutralizing responses and broadened the reactivity spectrum to encompass newer strains, with the highest increase in neutralization activity being more pronounced against XBB.1.5 (15.8-fold) and JN.1 (13.3-fold) than against BA.5 (6.7-fold) and WT (4-fold). Notably, XBB.1.5 and JN.1 were resistant to neutralization by pre-vaccination sera. There were no safety concerns. Our findings support updating of COVID-19 vaccines to match antigenically divergent variants and exclude ancestral spike-antigen to protect HTRs.",2024-03-31 17:14

"NO!  From the CDC website :   Who Should NOT Get Vaccinated If you have had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or an immediate allergic reaction, even if it was not severe, to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (such as polyethylene glycol), you should not get either of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. If you had a severe or immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get a second dose of either of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. A severe allergic reaction is one that needs to be treated with epinephrine or EpiPen or with medical care. Learn about common side effects of COVID-19 vaccines and when to call a doctor. An immediate allergic reaction means a reaction within 4 hours of exposure, including symptoms such as hives, swelling, or wheezing (respiratory distress). If you aren’t able to get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you may still be able to get a different type of COVID-19 vaccine. Get more information for people with allergies.",2021-08-11 21:07

Herd immunity also takes into account the effectiveness of the vaccine.  So if the effectiveness is 95% sure herd immunity could be 70%. Now the delta variant lowers that effectiveness so herd immunity has to compensate by going up.   It's not moving goal posts its a mutation in the virus.

I think I've been very careful in not trying to put words in his mouth but instead commenting on the hypothetical people seem to be arguing which has become 'it's okay to lie to protect the supply' which is contextually supported by phrases like ""ethically grey"" (there's nothing ethically grey about saying something that doesn't work doesn't work) and ""game theoretical"" which is justifying lying in order to enable the supply line. I made sure to specifically state:  >not sure if Fauci actually said this but people are defending this line as if he actually said it when it's ethically untenable under modern medicine's standards.  This line being that masks are useless for the public in order to curb coronavirus. Obviously if he didn't actually say it, he's not at fault. My concern is more the people supporting that logic rather than with Fauci specifically which is why I included a caveat on both of my first responses to various threads in this post.  The point is that medical professionals have an obligation to provide accurate and precise information and that people defending this whole ""game theory"" side is pure nonsense. Turning public health into a game of chess is inadvisable and would have incredibly negative long term consequences - this is the exact logic being protected and words that Fauci may not have said are being used as a proxy for this issue.",2020-04-02 23:52

"I am telling you, you will be fine financially and if you went into medicine for the right reasons, and it seems that you did, you will find fulfillment.  I spent past ten years guiding med students through their residencies and early careers, and so far have not found one that was disappointed with their choices.  You do have to be a bit smart about contracting from the get go (know the wRVU production norms in your region before you walk into that interview, etc.), and be ready to work hard long hours early on (moonlighting, etc.), but in the end your debt will be manageable.  I am sure you understand the trade offs.  In the Netherlands and other advanced health systems, education is free, but the doctors cap out at moderate incomes, comparable with the rest of society's professional class.  In America, you incur seemingly great debt, but you make it up with far greater lifetime income potential.  And it is that potential, spread over decades of your professional life, for which you pay.  In short, it is an investment, something I am sure you understood when you signed up for it.  There are caveats.  Medical schools charging full price for the fourth year is daylight robbery as the students spend their times on away rotations and their school does nothing outside of writing the deans letter.  They will tell you that they are merely spreading the cost evenly over the four years, but I do agree with you that current prices went overboard.  Schools charging the third years this year is even worse, for this is where the clinicals should be happening and no amount of online instruction can sub for that.  But all I want to do here, and I don't usually spend any time on reddit, is to inject a little hope into your, and your fellow med students, perception of things.  There are lofty popularized ideas and then there is a cold hard fact that my team and I have spent 49 consecutive grueling days fighting for each and every life in that ICU of ours.  What do we have to show for these efforts? Dozens of patients lost and two saved.  Tens of nurses, doctors, respiratory techs working full time in our tight masks and getting exposed to the deadliest COVID cases you can find, and all we got is two patients.  But those two, oh were they worth it.  We dont watch TV, listen to the rhetoric...just get up each morning and work...and trust me once you do that, you look around your team and recognize...this took courage.  Real courage that has nothing to do with the bs you hear on TV, as you say.  So, as I sat here in my home isolation room on that first day off after 7 weeks of non stop stress, I had nothing to do and found this thread.  And I am here to tell you again, you will be privileged to do incredible work in your life and please do not stress about the debt.  Work hard, be smart with your money and things will be ok.

"I got my Pfizer second shot early in the day Saturday. I was feeling fine throughout the day with no side effects. Because I thought I was good, I went out for some drinks. At around 10:00 that night, things took a turn for the worst. 

I got the chills, which worried my friends as the place was objectively hot. I went home, now having chills, sweats, fever, headache, nausea, and shortness of breath. I vomited and then tried to get to sleep without much success. 

Eventually it became morning and I had a big headache, fever, chills/sweats, and shortness of breath. I assumed these were normal symptoms, so I just tried to rest. I would have spasms of shortness of breath, where it would hurt to breath and I would hyperventilate, making my heart race. These would last about an hour and a half. I will call these “attacks” from here on out. Outside of that, all normal. 

Monday I woke up with chest pain. Most of the other symptoms were either gone or way down, but my upper body was sore. I assumed this was just residual discomfort and moved on. It was a pretty good day. 

Monday night I woke up middle of the night drenched in my own sweat, freezing, headache, struggling to breathe. This would be the first of a few “attacks” to come my way - I got back to sleep, then it happened again in the morning. Due for the fact that my side effects worsened from Monday to Tuesday, I went to the ER. 

In the ER, they performed a couple of tests. My ekg was normal, blood pressure was normal, etc. and most things were good. One thing that stood out to the doctors though was elevated levels of troponin. For those who do not know, this protein is found primarily in the muscles of the heart. It should have a reading of 0.0, as it is should not be in your blood. My reading was over 8 (unsure of units), which was high. They admitted me and diagnosed me with myocarditis. 

My level dropped throughout the day as low as 5ish, but I had another attack prior to going to sleep. This attack came with a higher level of chest pain than usual, so they gave me morphine and I eventually stabilized. They rechecked my levels and I was at 9. These attacks - likely caused by the inflamed heart - would put additional pressure on my heart , and make it worse. This is the problem with this condition - sometimes it just gets better over time, other times things degrade. Luckily for me, I have not had an attack since Tuesday and am set to be discharged today (Thursday) as my levels are back down. An echocardiogram (sonogram of heart) revealed no structural damage, and upon discharge I am set to rest and try to to get my heart rate up. 

(Note: I have no underlying medical conditions)

Edit: the units used for the protein in this post and all comments are ng/mL.",2021-05-27 21:49

"I think this blame game is extremely risky.  When someone gets covid it is not necessarily their ""fault"" - meaning they could have been following every single guideline perfectly and because their apple was touched by an essential worker who was asymptomatic with covid and actively shedding virus, they got it.  So he may have been isolating (I have no idea).  The problem is there is no way to be 100% isolated.  Even if you don't leave your house or see your friends, you have to eat and food is delivered - mail is delivered there are small interactions or touching of objects.  Furthermore, he's 87.  He definitely had at least one doctors appointment over the last year - that is considered essential but not necessarily risk free.  Masks limit spread but don't eliminate it completely.  The problem is EVERYONE needs be isolating and wearing masks and washing hands etc.    So if you would isolate to the moon and back if you were 87 - you should isolate to the moon and back at whatever your age currently is.  That is the WHOLE thing with covid - we should all be doing that to protect the 87 year olds.  I am much younger than 87.  If I get covid I will (statistically speaking) be fine.  I could realistically live my life without following any of the covid protocols and be fine.  But I understand that this is my contribution to society - not being an asshole, wearing a mask on my face, using zoom to keep in touch with friends, drinking at home instead of at a bar.

"Maybe take that out on the people who refused to get vaccinated when THEY WORK IN MEDICAL. The people who traditionally require the most medical care are the ones who are really the incubators for the variants. Immunocompromised people. Like me. A virus passing from one vaccinated person to another vaccinated person doesn’t have a whole lot of time, and therefore chance, to mutate. It’s when it hits someone like myself. I’ve had two Moderna shots and I’ll get the booster as soon as it is available in my area again. The amount of antibodies I’ve gained from those two shots is very small. So let’s say I get smacked in the face with Delta. Much higher odds that I’m going to be seriously ill and as close to certain as can be that I’ll be significantly more ill than a normal person. So it gets to sit in me, having a nice little vacation, looking at the sights and taking its time. And mutating.   It’s as close to proven as it really can be that the Alpha and Delta variants were born in that exact way; an immunocompromised person who spent weeks to months dealing with the virus. A virus never stops evolving, but it needs TIME to do that. If you’ve gotten vaccinated, you’re denying that virus much needed time to learn and mutate. Just like how you’re not sick for an extended time in the hospital. Maybe you get a breakthrough infection, but you’re not giving the virus the chance to learn what it needs to know from you to become bigger and badder.  I can hear the cries of “well then you stay home!” But you see, that’s just ignorance and selfishness. I take Humira. And Humira is the highest selling drug in the world. The people yearling that don’t care to know that I’m not a cancer patient. I haven’t had an organ transplant. I’m a 38 woman who owns a business and you’d never know by looking at me that my immune system is almost nonexistent.   But I’m the patient you see much more frequently than others. Just normally. Without a pandemic going on.  Fact: the vaccine makes it less likely you will catch COVID. It also DOES reduce the spread and ANY reduction is STILL REDUCTION.   Those medical “professionals” who refused to get a vaccine SHOULD be fired. They are either ignorant of their own field or uncaring assholes when it comes to their most frequently seen patients, or both I guess. But don’t think for a moment that variants wouldn’t slow way the hell down if everyone would get the vaccines. It would. Because you’d stop infecting ME. And THAT would be where you’d REALLY knock COVID out. If I’m not sick for an extended time, wow. You’ve just really taken away the prime way that this virus continues to mutate at such an astronomical pace.  And bonus, you’re way less likely to end up in your own ICU, bogging down your coworkers, and way WAY less likely to be taking that last chance to live ECMO from people like me.   To have my own selfish asshole moment, I deserve that bed and that ECMO more. I got my vaccines. I felt like shit afterwards. I feel like shit after my flu vaccine every year. Same with my pneumonia vaccine. Maybe I didn’t get many or any antibodies BUT I TRIED.   If you are too stupid to understand science and how basic shit like vaccines work, I don’t want you to be giving me health advice.

Could it potentially have a long term side effect? yes.  at your age of 24 you should be ok to handle a covid infection, but then again the ""media"" keeps reporting that young and healthy unvaccinated adults are dying from covid.

Dont know if I can say it was a ""pain"" the feeling around heart

So I went to doctor, she told me it CANT be because of vaccine, she did blood tests, everything fine, then I went to cardiologist, she found nothing, that my heart is healthy af.. I had similar symptoms as with myocarditis. and yet they found nothing, so I went home cause just body is ""adjusting"" to vaccine.

So I went also for second vaccine, and everything continued, I dont have the really fast heart beating anymore, but on day to day basis I feel my heart that something is ""there"", like light pressure beneath it. I am going to pay for tests on my own right now...  we will see...

The pain faded out a little, but it was still really bad at times. I got the second shot mid November. The pain started to get a lot worse after this. I once again visited my GP and he ordered a blood test and a breast ultrasound. The blood test said that my iron levels were borderline low, but nothing too bad. The breast ultrasound was also normal. The pain continued for another 2 months. I also experienced shortness of breath and occasional back pain. The pain spiked sometimes and got worse. Eventually, in January I once again visited my GP, and he took things more seriously this time. He ordered an ECG and a heart muscle blood test. I done the tests and the heart muscle test seemed mostly fine, but the ECG was abnormal. It showed a right bundle branch block/arrhythmia. The GP referred me to a cardiologist and my booking is next week.

"No, you still have immunologic memory. The problem (to vastly oversimplify) comes from the fact that memory is established in the blood, and memory cells circulate in the blood. When the memory cells encounter the antigen again it triggers a new wave of immune cells in the blood, which pump out the primary defensive antibody, IgG. (Lots of other stuff going on, but that’s level one.)  Covid is at least initially a respiratory virus. It enters through the respiratory mucosa, which is defended by IgA, not IgG. IgA is stimulated by vaccines (and infection) but it doesn’t have much memory, so it fades with time. Your memory cells in the bloodstream aren’t awakened until they learn about the infection, but by that point, you’ve got it. But on the flip side, that’s why the vaccines are more effective at mitigating the more dangerous vascular symptoms. We can fight it much more effectively in the blood.   As of January 2020, no one had ever developed a vaccine that establishes stable true immunity to a respiratory virus. That’s still true. No one had ever developed a very effective vaccine to a coronavirus at all. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both exceeded expectations (the expectations of biologists who understand vaccines).

Meanwhile the US buries their head in the sand and this overwhelms the health services. We get 4-5x the % of the population infected that China has, and we spend many more months trying to get hospitals back to normal. The higher death rate impacts citizens and businesses more seriously than in China, with mortgage defaults, medical bankruptcies, and childcare complications. A deeper recession takes hold.

"You are not protecting just them.

But those low odds are significant because of the wide circulation of the virus because not everyone got vaccinated, in US and in other countries where you or other people of US travel to.

"Culturally, Japan is very communal, and masks have been worn by people that are sick there for a long time (pre COVID) to protect others for getting sick.  They are generally compliant with mask wearing due to this history and have not politicized the issue.  Americans are the exact opposite, rugged individualism is part of the DNA, people feel the right to do what they want, and many want government out of their lives.  Add in the US leadership has not had a cohesive message that is focusing on facts and data, and that leadership made masks a partisan issue (and have not served as good examples for the people), leaning into that individualism.  This has gone so far as to now have people that have been tested positive, refusing to cooperate with contract tracing.  Citizens of the US are refusing to participate in the good for the entire society.  Our individualism is in the way.    All that gets us here, and is why this will continue much longer that it could have.

"I'm not an expert by any means but I'd like to try to help!  The only corners we ""cut"" during the development of this vaccine were actually things that were researched ahead of time - Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA vaccine delivery technique was already patented and proved safe for human use over the course of several years of study, they just didn't have a disease to actually vaccinate for using this method until COVID came along.  Similarly with the vaccines not using the mRNA delivery method, those were made using delivery systems that had been proven safe and are in use for other related diseases like the flu shot.  That cut about 12-16 months or so off of the time it would have taken to get a vaccine approved.  Most of the rest of the ""cut"" corners were in manufacturing time: instead of saving money by only manufacturing just enough vaccine to get through testing, then setting up the infrastructure for mass production, vaccine companies went whole hog on producing and stockpiling the vaccine so that it would be ready to deliver to the mass market the second the FDA approved it.  The only last corner cut was actually genuinely cut: waiting to see how long immunity from the vaccine will last.  The only way to know that would have been to wait several years to see if any of the vaccinated test subjects come down with COVID years down the line.  Because of the time we're in, the scientists and powers that be decided that **possibly** short-term immunity for everyone RIGHT NOW is more important than **possibly** longer-lasting immunity by changing up the vaccine somehow.  Even with this, we are not in the dark, because we know that the closely related SARS virus has a 2-3 year window of immunity to catching the disease again.  The major concerns about dose effectiveness, side effects, and dangers of vaccinating have all been carefully studied over the last few months.  We really will be safe taking this vaccine when it comes out, it will be fine if we all need to get boosters every year or every few years, and when the immediate pressure is off there may be a longer-lasting vaccine available that will be safe as well.   Hope this helps!  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Edit: quick addition that we do not actually know how safe this vaccine is for children under 18, but that is because the legal and ethical standards for testing medicine on children is very high!  Now that we know the vaccine is save for a wide range of ages of adults, there are going to be further tests to make sure it is safe for younger and younger age groups.  The first step is figuring out if 12-17 year olds can take it.  This should not stop adults from getting the vaccine in the meantime, and adults spread COVID more and are more affected by it so prioritizing the vaccination of adults makes perfect sense.  The vaccine is safe, and I can't wait to take it!",2020-12-03 3:15
"If this were the black death the people would be demanding a vaccine and blaming their government for letting them die by the millions. They would be fighting over a spot for the vaccine because life is generally better than death.  There is a real solid chance mathematically that you are alive today as a direct result of a vaccine. Being forced to take it shouldn't even be an issue. That's just being stubborn because you can be and risking your life while you do it.  It's like those idiots who walk around town with their assault rifles to provoke the cops into a response so they can affirm their rights to do so. Yes they are legally right but it's still risking their life to prove a point.  The real question is.. What part about taking the vaccine has you worried? Vaccination is proven to work beyond a doubt through history and no one can deny that.  I think that the government should mandate that all vaccinations for pandemic like events be required. Because it's not only your life you are risking its others around you.  The government also demands that you drive the speed limit. By your logic this is the government telling you what you can and can't do with your body and property. One person not getting vaccinated goes to the gas station and everyone else who want vaccinated because ""I got rights"" could end up catching it and dieing. This could lead to hundreds more deaths because ""I got rights"". This isn't you just risking your life. It's you risking other people's lives.  I personally believe that anyone who refuses to take it.. If that's an option should be held accountable at that point for who they infect. If contact tracing traces an infection back to you.. And that spread killed 15 people.. That should be 15 counts of manslaughter.  So if that was an option.. Like.. You can refuse but you are accountable for any positive cases that come from you..

"28M. 9 months of epididymo-orchitis here (right testicle) - started 2 weeks after I received my 2nd dose of AstraZeneca, at the end of June 2021 (which makes me think that's a side effect of it).

Been to 2 different urologists and 3 ultrasounds. Ultrasounds showed everything looks normal, besides that I have epididymo-orchitis. Urologists did urine, semen and blood tests too - no bacteria, infections or tumour markers were found (been with the same partner for 10 years anyway). Hormone and testosterone levels are normal too. Sperm levels are extremely low, but this is likely caused by a surgery I had as a child (undescended testicles) and I've already accepted my infertility. It also never caused me any problems before the epididymitis started 9 months ago anyway.

No antibiotics were prescribed as there is no infection. They just told me to take ibuprofen when it hurts, or if it continues, they ""can try cipro"". Needless to explain, i said NO. Ibuprofen eases the pain, but it usually comes back shortly after.

Symptoms :pain comes when I sit or lay in bed for long period of times. When I am standing or walking the pain is non-existent. Epididymitis is thick , as well as the bottom of my right testicle (feels like the surface is harsh and I often get sharp 1-2 seconds of very bad pain there, accompanied with itching too). After ejaculation, the pain is briefly relieved, but then it starts again on the next day.

I am fortunate to have enough money saved to get through a month or so of bills, but this is going to be a hard time for most adults who live paycheck to paycheck.

I think people having asthma attacks (like, currently having an attack) are allowed to take their mask off until it subsides too.

But my family like mom and grandma and aunt all are very right wing conservative, and at the time my mom and stepdad were going down the Quanon rabbit hole. 

I will say that before the shots, I really did not have much health problems. I mean, I had anxiety, and panic attacks. But like a year or so after getting the shots, my health kind of went down- I got diagnosed with Intracranial Hypertension, Papilledema, Optic Nerve swelling, depression, and the doctors thought I had some heart problem like a fib, and I’ve gone to heart doctors and done stress tests, echocardiograms, but turned out I have POTS. I just got diagnosed with POTS a few days ago. 

My family had told me when I got diagnosed with the first health problem, that “the shot was a dumb idea” or “you don’t know what’s in that shot, it could be harmful to you” and continued to spew the  stuff that mainstream news says like fox and cnn. I just ignored it for the most part. However I decided to just do some of my own research because it’s apparent that my health has gone down and changed since I got the shot. But idk if the shot IS the reason why but from doing my research I did find out that there’s a possible link between POTS and Covid shot but idk I feel like it could be a coincidence? Hmm, 🧐 What do you think? 

TLDR; was healthy before the covid shot, and about a year after the shot I began having health issues, and recently got diagnosed with POTS and family thinks the covid shot is what caused the health problems I now have. What do you think? 🤔 ",2025-04-11 11:33

"I am a fool. I am an idiot. I have been working out for ninety minutes a day for three days in a row. I needed to get my vaccine. It was time to finally bite the bullet. I grabbed myself by the trypanophobic nutsack and got myself a next day appointment. 

So. I work out for ninety minutes and show up freshly showered and on the verge of tears to the rite aid where I’m going to get jabbed. I wanted J&amp;J because needles FREAK me out. And I would back out if I knew I had to get another shot in two weeks. 

Point is. I figure. Huh. Work at 7am the next day? I can do that. That’s fine. It was fine. I slept in a little but made it there when I needed to be. It is now 2 pm. I was pulled into a surprised 14 hours shift and the slowly building headache is agony. My body is shaking and I hurt everywhere. Im not going to leave so uh. Here’s to advil and a gallon of water. 

I have a question. How long until this fades? Am I going to have to work until 9 pm like this?? Then come back at 7am the next day?

Edit: I am pro vax. I have a history of vax reactions according to my anti vax mother. I didn’t get it because the doctor she was taking me to when Covid happened(I was a minor) said I shouldn’t get it.

"Very well articulated, especially for someone your age! I respect that you have really taken the time to study all outcomes and theoretical possibilities.   >the vaccine has been repeatedly proved to harm a person's body and immune system, instead of fortifying it. It is not producing antibodies right. Any positive effects also wear of within months, so boosters will be essential. However, the vaccine is only targeting the spike of the virus. This allows the virus room to mutate and get around people's immune defenses. Rather, if your body fights off the virus, it is killed, and you gain resilience and immunity.   This could indeed cause a problem long term, as Geert Vanden Bossche theorizes; in the case of mass vaccinations leading to vaccine resistant variants, we could be in a bad position due to an inability to sterilize the virus upon infection. Moreso, I'm not sure about the spike protein ""harming a person's immune system"", though, in a scenario where the vaccine becomes ineffective due to a more resilient mutation - the existing memory from the S protein may impede our ability to create a new defensive immune response to the new variation of virus. The same could occur to an attenuated vaccine, if one is made in the future, rendering it incapable of producing immunity in previously vaccinated individuals. (Note: I don't know the likelihood of attenuated vaccines being produced in the near future).  As for harming your body: it's true that a circumstance of this variation of mrna vaccines, unfortunately seems to be that the lipid nanoparticles used to transport the messenger rna to your cells (which then create the spike protein, for your immune system to learn from), don't stay where they should. The issue being that in the event that spike protein is produced by other cells in your body i.e. brain, spinal chord, ovaries etc, your immune system will begin to target and eliminate otherwise healthy and necessary cells in your body.   For this reason, alot of people are very hopeful about novavax, which uses moth cells to multiply a version of baculovirus which is modified to include the spike protein. Though, it doesn't have the same level of data as the other vaccines and it uses the very same spike protein, this method of delivery could be safer, especially for younger age groups.   But very well written. I hope you continue to grow, learn and use your talents to find interests, happiness and success for yourself!   - By the way, lockdowns are very tough mentally. Try to exercise, even if it's just a few sit ups, pushups and pull ups or some running or football.. and get as much sun as possible.

I had to argue one day for an alternative to opioids for a pt with gastric sleeve and NSAID induced PUD,  because they would’ve cover ANYTHING reasonable like lidocaine patches, voltaren gel, lyrica, but gladly would let us write for 90 Norco and have the patient just ileus their way into the hospital the next week. I seriously keep the pdfs of every updated formulary I can find open on my computer at all times, prescribe 99% generic drugs, except when there is not that option or when a insurance plan randomly decides that they only allow the brand name to be covered. Yes , it’s a real thing, and it’s stupid as fuck. They’ve called and wanted me to rewrite the prescription as “brand name medically necessary”.

"So I watched the videos and more importantly read the sources that they cited. The concern they raise is that the spike protein in SARS–CoV–2 prevents the body from forming a strong immune response which is why people with severe cases of covid often don't have strong immunity. The conclusion of the study is that vaccines using the full spike protein may be less effective, not that they will be dangerous. They suggest that a vaccine using partial spike proteins would possibly be more effective because they wouldn't inhibit the bodies immune response in the same way. However, this is an in vitro study, not a study on actual living humans. Studies on live humans have shown that the vaccines are very effective and safe (not 100% effective or safe but the benefits significantly outweigh the risks).     Additionally, any risks associated with the spike protein also apply to if you get covid. And while the vaccines only effect as small number of your cells and are quickly eliminated from your body, covid can spread widely within your body causing much more damage.",2021-11-16 21:59

"> **Background and Objectives:**  >  > After recovering from COVID-19, patients may experience persistent symptoms, known as post-COVID-19 syndrome or long COVID, which include a range of continuing health problems. This research explores the prevalence, associated factors, and overall health outcomes of long COVID during a period of extensive vaccination and antiviral treatment availability in Thailand.  >  > **Materials and Methods:** This observational study involved 390 adult patients with COVID-19 between January and March 2022. Beginning three months after their diagnosis, these patients were interviewed via telephone every three months for a period of one year. The data collection process included gathering demographic information and administering a standardized questionnaire that addressed the patients’ physical condition following COVID-19, their mental health, sleep disturbances, and overall quality of life.  >  > **Results:**  >  > The cohort consisted of 390 participants, with an average age of 31.8 ± 13.6. Among them, 96.7% (n = 377) were vaccinated, and 98.2% (n = 383) underwent antiviral treatment. Long-COVID prevalence was observed at 77.7%, with the most frequently reported symptoms being fatigue (64.1%) and cough (43.9%). Regarding mental health, depression was reported by 8.2% of the participants, anxiety by 4.1%, and poor sleep quality by 33.3%. Advanced statistical analysis using multivariable logistic regression showed significant links between long-COVID symptoms and patients aged below 60 (p = 0.042), as well as the initial symptom of cough (p = 0.045). In the subset of long-COVID sufferers, there was a notable correlation in females with symptoms such as headaches (p = 0.001), dizziness (p = 0.007), and brain fog (p = 0.013). >  > **Conclusions:** Despite the extensive distribution of vaccines and antiviral therapies, the prevalence of long COVID remains high, being associated particularly with individuals under 60 and those exhibiting a cough as an early symptom. The study further reveals that mental health issues related to long COVID are profound, going beyond the scope of physical symptomatology.",2024-03-01 2:38

"28M, double vaxxed and got my booster late November 2021 (all Moderna). Had Covid late May-early June 2022 (most likely BA.2.1.12), mild case and fully recovered.

I’m hesitant to get this new booster for a few reasons: 1) they feel rushed to the public without much data behind them; 2) the data that is available doesn’t indicate that it prevents transmission; and 3) a new variant could arise at any time that makes these boosters irrelevant.

I want to follow the science, but I also don’t want to fall into a pattern where I’m getting multiple boosters a year that are consistently behind the virus’ evolution and ultimately don’t do much. I can tolerate getting a shot once per year like the flu, but anything more than that feels excessive, especially since the side effects from the initial shots and booster hit me HARD and knocked me out for multiple days each time.

Does anyone else share my hesitations? I want a reason to get another booster, but I’m having a hard time finding one.",2022-09-07 12:19

"> If >2% of the population is already infected, it's all over except the actual dying part.  ABSOLUTELY NOT.  Flattening the Curve is about slowing the rate that most of us get it. And if we slow it enough with social distancing measures (there's a 17 day delay between measures and effect on the curve), then our hospitals can keep up and the fatality rate stays under 1%.   If the hospitals crash (as they are definitely going to in the US, because we haven't yet seen strong enough social distancing, plus the 17 day lag), then the fatality rate skyrockets.

"There are no promising vaccines and vaccines are not cures.  We don't even have any safety data on them yet.  The US going this quickly into human trials is the most disgraceful thing I have ever seen the medical community due in 40 years.   There is hydroxychoroquine, Remdesivir, Quercetin, and ritonavir and lopinavir  All of these have verified anecdotal evidence verified from multiple sources.  All of these have clinical trials behind them showing them to be effective against different viruses.  We have varying degrees of safety data backed up by clinical trials on all of these drugs.    Is it the gold standard? No.  However given the circumstances the right move is to put these into action.  Belgium started doing it last week.  I bet you out of all of the western world Belgium will fare the best unless we ditch this clinical trial religion.   All of the countries that have this under control are using some of these treatment methods.    These drugs show a reduction in viral load in patients far faster than seen in subjects where the immune system fights it off alone.  4-6 days to see 100% reduction in the virus... with 75% of the subjects not having any detectable virus.  The remaining subjects with less than 25% of the virus they previously tested with.  Science isn't the end all be all.  It is not God.  Logic and Math are equally important if not more important than science.    Western medicine gives advice that says we shouldn't be wearing a mask in this pandemic as the public.  Clinical trials don't support the notion they protect you from getting the virus.    So you might get the virus.  We have studies that show that reducing the viral load will lessen the severity of the illness caused by bacteria and/or viruses.    We know that this virus is contagious during the asymptomatic period.  You could be spreading it without even knowing it.  Therefore everyone should wear a mask unless they know they are immune to the virus.    We should be making our own masks at home.  Wearing them every time we're out side and all the time inside a home with a suspected infected individual.   When logic can be used to destroy the ""advice"" science based western medicine puts out.   It's an indication that western medicine is not science based and is a dogmatic religion.   Game theory (Math) tell us our best course of action was to begin using the most safety tested treatments mentioned above weeks ago.  Worst case scenario in using the drugs along side the known well tested safety trials the drugs do not work and produce no significant harm to the patients.  This could have been done with a massive trial essentially randomizing the various treatments in many different arms to find out which is the best.  A well designed study could have produced data that would indicate treatment decisions in real time.  As the study progressed Arms could have been closed out and moved to the most promising treatment arm.    If any of the arms proved to be effective combined with social distancing our medical systems throughout most of the western world could have been dealing with a smaller number of patients.  Now we're facing most medical systems facing imminent overrun in the next few weeks and no tools to use it.  Hopefully Remdesivir's trial was constructed well and ran well.  Its the earliest trial I am aware of and the results are expected April 1st.  My understanding is production of the drug is already underway so hopefully by the first week in April we'll have it out there working on patients.",2020-03-23 20:55

"I've seen so many posts on Reddit and on social media about how people can't stand the unvaccinated. And look at us in disgust. Like we are the plague. And it's like many people don't even look at us like we are human with actual feelings and legitimate reasons behind our reservations. They only see selfish anti vaxer and that's it. For me it's fear of the potential severe side effects that could show up now or years from now. I've had other vaccines and I felt more comfortable taking those since they've been around for so long, but the COVID vaccine gives me extreme anxiety to the point where I have panic attacks just thinking about getting the vaccine. Even though I know there is minimal risk for severe reactions. But for me, I believe there is also minimal risk of me getting really sick from COVID since I've had it before with very minimal illness. Along with being exposed to COVID from my husband without knowing it and I didn't catch it. Despite being around him a lot in close proximity all day long. So when I weigh the risk for myself, I believe my own immune response is handling the virus pretty well. This is just my PERSONAL belief. Not saying this should apply to everyone.

And for those who think all of us unvaccinated are inconsiderate/ selfish, some of us do take precautions.  When the CDC reports that COVID numbers in my area is going up or if I'm around someone who is high risk, I wear a mask to try and prevent spreading COVID in case I was to have it without knowing it. That makes me feel more comfortable since I can take the mask off. Whereas a vaccine is more long term. I can't just take it out. 

I'm not trying to encourage anyone not to take the COVID vaccine. I'm not spreading misinformation. I'm only speaking for myself and only me. I actually would encourage people to take the vaccine if they feel that's the best decision for them. But I also believe other people who don't feel comfortable taking the vaccine should not be shamed for it. (*Also believe people shouldn't be shamed FOR getting the vaccine from the unvaccinated as well.) I think it's pretty ridiculous that people are shaming people that genuinely don't feel comfortable injecting something in their body without knowing how it's going to effect them. And I wish people wouldn't automatically assume the worst about someone because they didn't get the COVID shot and not lump us all into the same category of antivaxers. Before we shame the unvaccinated, we don't know everyone personally and how this COVID vaccine really effects them. For me, I take COVID very seriously and have spent a great deal of time thinking over what would be the best decision for my situation.

***If you're going to downvote I would love to hear your actual opinion rather than just downvoting because I have a different opinion than you. This is exactly what I mean.

"I’m a 34F, struggle with severe anxiety/panic/agoraphobia, which has worsened since the pandemic started last year. I also have pretty bad asthma that gets worse in the spring. My mother lives with me, she has a heart condition and I spend a lot of time around my older grandmothers as well. I was hesitant to get the shot, and anxious as hell about even going into a store (Walgreens) let alone to get a brand new vaccine. 

First shot, I pushed through the panic, my first time in a store in over a year, and got the shot. The process didn’t hurt at all, but I did have a bit of panic immediately following the shot that caused my heart rate to jump up. The next day I had some brain fog and felt very achy. Anxiety was high for a week after, all the what if’s rolling around in my brain didn’t help. 2 weeks out I was still anxious and hyper focused on any little change in my body. I was fine but my mental health told me otherwise. 

Second shot, 3 days ago. Anxiety had kept me on high alert the whole week before the shot. All the one off horror stories online kept me awake at night. When I got the shot I played some calming music on my headphones and asked the nurse to not tell me right after the shot so I wouldn’t panic. She waited for a few minutes to pass, then told me it was done. No jump in heart rate, I was fine. 

4 hours after the second shot I started getting nauseous, achy and sweaty. I waited a while, then took some Tylenol for my achy arm. No fever 

12 hours after- woke up with a severely swollen lymph node under my injection arm. I couldn’t put any pressure on it at all, even the weight of my arm hurt. I took some more Tylenol. Sweaty, tired, dizzy and nauseous. Laid in bed and tried to distract myself with some Netflix but I was restless. No fever.

24 hours after- very sore arm and lymph node. Sweating buckets. I always am super hydrated but I kept downing water and pedialyte. Felt well enough to get up and play with my dog for about ten minutes and then I was spent again. Still no fever. 

48 hours after- decided to take some Advil for the swollen lymph node. Immediately started feeling better a few hours later. Still anxious, sweaty and nauseous. 

Woke up today and I feel AMAZING. I don’t know if it was all the sleep or the Advil, but I haven’t felt this good in a long time. Lymph node is still tender but the swelling has gone way down. So much relief in knowing it is all done. 

I’m excited to get back to where I was pre-pandemic, eating dinner with family, going into stores to shop, and eventually traveling once it is safe to do so. 

To anyone who has anxiety, let me just say it is worth it. I am probably the most anxious person around, I am hypersensitive to everything, and have obsessive health thoughts/worries. But knowing that in two weeks if I do get covid I won’t die, that is worth the whole rollercoaster of getting this shot.

Americans simply can not afford to not got to work, which clearly places them in a situation where they are around other humans more than most and so the virus can get around. Unlike in Europe, they'll be homeless in the event they do not go to work.

"I am very curious to know a bit more about how vaccines work (ideally in a ""i lost the game show are you smarter than a 5th grader"" way)

My understanding, albeit simplified, has always been that a vaccine basically gives you a ""template"" of sorts that matches the illness it's preventing. The template would also have either the answer key to defeating the illness or like a really good study guide to defeating it. So then if you are introduced to that illness in a less controlled environment you're body doesn't have to figure out how to fight it from scratch. And then if you get some symptoms from a vaccine its because the template is super similar to the real thing and your body is getting on hands on work experience by practicing defeating the illness. 

The reason i ask about all this is because i have had,  in the past, symptoms caused by vaccines. I recently though got a tdap booster in my left arm and flu & covid in my right. Tdap i was told would likely be the most sore/symptom provking but it is virtually painless and symptom free. The covid and flu though has its usual sorness and symptoms. 

I know having no symptoms after getting a vaccine is not a bad thing but it did make me go down the rabbit hole of wondering if post-vaccine pain/symptoms would ever correlate to how effective a vaccine is? I would love some articles or studies on this if anyone knows of any, just for pure curiosities sake. but if at all possible, snippets of articles/guidance on where to look/summaries/etc. Would be very much appreciated as my reading comprehension level seems to plummet through the floor when i am reading any sort of academic research. 

For reference:
- i get covid & flu every year since ive been able. 
- Dtap set of 5 doses was from 2002(birth yr)-2007(this is so spread out due to other life happenings)
-  last Tdap booster was 2013 (i had whooping cough around this time so the booster was a bit earlier than 10 years)

But afterwards, from January onwards, it's hard to overstate how useful the journal articles those overworked doctors published are, or how important the country-wide actions were. They form the basis of the treatment regime of Covid-19, and much of what we know about it. That it spread relatively slowly once Wuhan was locked down means that plenty of governments had time *and information*, which China didn't when it first broke, to prepare for it. Ever since it broke, China health authorities + citizens have been screaming from the rooftops to be prepared when or if it hits.  Some countries prepared. Most didn't.",2020-03-23 2:12

"I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease after getting an influenza shot, less than 40 days later I lost consciousness  on my way to work. I woke up in hospital with my kids and wife at my side.  Here are a few points which can give you ideas for your book :  It is very unlucky but it can happen for many reasons including vaccine as well. For some reason which are not yet very well known your autoimmune system decides to overreact and start attacking tissues which it is not supposed to.  One of reasons why some people are dying of covid-19 is because at time of death even though the virus load is 0% the immune system went a bit crazy...  There are many things which can trigger an autoimmune disease(virus, bacteria, stress, vaccine, allergy), about 20 years ago the Hepatitis B vaccine was removed on some countries because it seemed like it would trigger an autoimmune reaction much more than what was anticipated. It took more than 10 years of thorough study to show that it was not the case for some countries like France to reintroduce it.  For your book one scenario idea could be a rna vaccine which is using transcriptase inverse using some enzyme which was not identified before to modify some gene which would produce some defect in white blood cells :-)  Note 1: I got vaccinated for covid-19, and even though my condition got triggered likely by a vaccine in the past I always consider the benefice risk and talk with my Neurologist knowing that getting a vaccine will also potentially have some negative effects.

Sera obtained from 37, 30 and 30 XBB.1.5, BA.1 and BA.4-5 -vaccine recipients, respectively, were tested for anti-RBD IgG and for JN-1 specific neutralizing antibody levels. Geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) in JN.1 specific neutralizing titers was 27 (95 % CI: 17–43.1), 10.1 (95 % CI: 6.48–15.7) and 8.77 (95 % CI: 5.69–13.5) following XBB.1.5, BA.1 and BA.4-5 vaccines, respectively, translating into a 64 % lower adjusted response (geometric mean ratio [GMR] = 0.36, 95 % CI: 0.21–0.6) in the BA.1 arm, and a 75 % lower response (GMR = 0.25, 95 % CI: 0.15–0.43) in the BA.4-5 arm.

Our new shut down is also supposed to only last through november to surpress cases to a level where we can have a somewhat normal christmas. That doesn't look too good either right now. We got a compromise where schools, churches and retail remain open and only restaurants, hotel, sports and leisure activity are shut down. So basically work, school and nothing else for a month.  New cases are still rising, just slower than before, percentage wise.  So christmas without lockdown is out the window if you look at it realistically.

"Aug 28, 2024:        **Highlights:**    - XBB.1.5 monovalent (MV) booster elicits neutralizing titers up to 6 months after dose      - Titers wane more slowly after XBB.1.5 MV booster than after BA.5 bivalent booster      - XBB.1.5 MV booster partially mitigates immunological imprinting      **Summary**   Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-neutralizing antibodies are substantially expanded 1 month after a shot of XBB.1.5 monovalent mRNA vaccine (XBB.1.5 MV) booster, but the durability of this response remains unknown. Here, we address this question by performing neutralization assays on four viral variants (D614G, BA.5, XBB.1.5, and JN.1) using sera from participants obtained at ∼1 month, ∼3 months, and ∼6 months post an XBB.1.5 MV booster. Our findings indicate that the resulting neutralizing antibody titers are robust and generally remain at stable levels for the study period, similar to those following XBB infection. Importantly, this durability of neutralizing antibody titers contrasts with the decline observed after a booster of the original monovalent or BA.5 bivalent mRNA vaccine. Our results are in line with the recent national data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, showing that the efficacy against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is sustained for up to 4 months after an XBB.1.5 MV booster.",2024-09-04 7:33

"Thanks for your response. Don't worry, you didn't offend at all. I apologize if I gave that impression as well. Thank you so much for all the hard work and direct patient care you do. I can't tell you how much it makes our jobs easier and is appreciated.  As to what you were saying, I have seen quite a lot of support specific to nurses and non-physician healthcare workers myself. Sometimes to me it feels like nurses get all the appreciation from the public. *Everyone* feels like their branch of healthcare isn't getting the appreciation they deserve. Trust me. I've heard it in every which way and direction.  Truth is everyone is working so hard themselves that they don't have to time to look up and see how much their colleagues are hustling as well.  I understand what you mean with people not involved with direct covid care. I don't think a forgiveness bill like this would pass regardless, especially one that isn't targeted towards active, frontline healthcare workers.  Also, the ED is a different beast entirely for sure. Speed is everything. Those docs have to quickly decide whether this patient stays, goes, or is held to be watched. Need to know what to do, ask, or test to decide that. Also need to get the right tests or give the right drugs so when they do admit to a team that team doesn't immediately start complaining about how this urgent thing wasn't done.  In my view it is unfair to say that ER docs are worth less because of how little time they spend with patients because their speed ***is*** their skill. The experience and knowledge-base that only they have is what allows them to spend just 5min with a patient and know what to do. Someone else in that position in a time crunch could miss something that completely changes everything - what looks like a standard admit or discharge for xyz that you could do in your sleep is suddenly a big fucking deal.  That's what they get paid to do and to be. I don't like a system that needs and incentivizes that kind of lightning fast care. Personal, humanistic care is important beyond the bottom line. But it's the system we have.  We shouldn't think less of colleagues who are performing the exact skills we demand of them. Especially when those skills are extremely difficult and take years of education and training to master.",2020-05-06 17:22

Europe has a population of 740 million (sorry I don't know if that's EU or the whole continent) which is slightly more than double the US.

"TLDR: WHO's TAG-CO-VAC recommends the switch from bivalent boosters to a monovalent formulation containing a XBB.1 descendant lineage for fall to winter boosters.

"This doesn’t read like a genuine question, but here’s a genuine answer: 1. If you contract COVID again, you are a greater threat. How the mRNA vaccine works is it enables the body to fight the the virus by preventing it from latching on, multiplying, and overloading your system. The greater the viral load, the greater the spread. Those who are vaccinated are not spreading COVID at the same rate as those who are unvaccinated. That is a fact. So the greater good is still on the table and children who can’t get vaccinated are among them. We do know how the current vaccines protect against the Delta variant. For example, Pfizer is 88% effective against the Delta variant, as opposed to a 94% efficacy rate against the alpha variant. Still excellent odds.  2. You don’t know which variant you had. You’re guessing. The Delta variant (thanks to those of you who have not been vaccinated) is now mutating again into a new and improved strain which will again put you at greater risk.  Get vaccinated and in the mean time wear a mask. For your health and the health of those around you. It’s that simple. We no longer deal with polio because vaccines work. COVID is no different, save a science denying population that is providing hosts like yourself for this virus to infect, mutate and continue to spread.  I’m sorry if I seem frustrated.

"Because words are fucking important. Socialism in common discourse brings imagery of countries like the USSR, Venezuela, and other failures. Saying that Democratic socialism is the same as socialism is a tool used to scare people away from any program that seeks to take the profit motive from one or two failing industries (e.g. healthcare and education). When you say ""Democratic socialism is socialism"" someone has already decided that everything associated with a Democratic Socialism platform will lead to bread lines and death. There are essentially zero Americans that want to completely removed capitalism from every industry. We want to fix the systems oligarchy-run industries that provide human rights. That is not the same as controlling the entire economy through community ownership.   When you say that policies are socialism, people who don't know more and are unwilling to research them flock to the right.

In what world would that even remotely have been a good idea  besides, everyone wearing masks isn't even close to being the most effective way to prevent transmission, this is droplet spread not airborne and surgical masks do very little to prevent aerosolized transmission, unless everyone had N95's but thank god that isn't happening",2020-04-02 20:59

"So, I've had both rounds of pfizer, fully Dec 1 2021. 

I've been having some really strange issues sense.

Random numbness/tingling at different points in the days. This could be anywhere from sleeping and waking up to pain and numbness/tingling on one side/both of my body. While standing/walking one side falling asleep. Numbness in my face during the day, my eye twitches a lot randomly. I've been really tired lately and my muscles are always sore, almost to the point of exhaustion.

Sometimes I have issues gripping things, randomly drop stuff.

I've made it a point to drink more water, thinking the soreness could be from possible dehydration.

Nothing has changed, no medicine changes or anything like that, there's been a couple more problems, but those are the most concerning.

"> We are less sure in our understanding of how to deal with coronavirus as a disease than we are sure in understanding the economic effect of it.  I think the opposite. We have all seen this disease thing play out hundreds of times.  It is bad, then they find some treatments that help, then eventually they get a vaccine that tamps the disease all the way out.  The first vaccine trials for COVID-19 just started.  On the economic front we just passed into totally uncharted territory.  We have NEVER shut down our own economy before on purpose.  Never. We have never before chosen to wipe out every last restaurant at the same time as every nail salon, barber, all the lowest income workers in America just got boned at the same time. We do know the “reboot” is extremely difficult from the few examples of recessions and 1 Great Depression.  So hard it is unclear what works.  The Great Depression required the largest war the world has ever seen for the US to recover - bomb the factories in Europe into the Stone Age and leave the US factories untouched to fill in the void.  I honestly have no idea what to do, but I am terrified of what we just did to the economy.  When you get 30% unemployment of young men age 18-25 governments topple.  Can you imagine how bad this is going to go when the starvation begins?  People can usually survive about 6 weeks without food, so we are ok for a little while, but I think we are about to see a lot of suicides and violence after that.

That’s doesn’t make him a controversial president. It makes his administration and by extension him flawed.   He’s still widely liked by most of the world despite the 536 civilians that died as a result of US army drone strikes. At least he had the guts to tell everyone and disclose his mistakes. Trunk recently made the reporting of civilian deaths from military operations non essential. What a lovely precedent to set.   You can play the dead children card with any president and drone strikes will continue to get higher and higher year by year do some time yet.it doesn’t take away from my point.

"mRNA has been studied for the last 50 or so years, and mRNA vaccines have been more recently studied as early as 2010 with clinical trials for influenza beginning 2015. There are plenty of foods, drinks, etc that human ingest that can also be cancerous, yet many ignore that. The COVID vaccine is one that reduces the spread of the virus significantly (yes, you can still get it, but at a much lower rate). The purpose of getting it isn't JUST to protect you, but also protect others as much as possible, especially ones who can't protect themselves (e.g. children/toddlers/babies).  Many argue the long term unknowns effects of the vaccine, but ignore the long term unknowns of the virus itself. My advice would be - listen to the scientists and doctors, not necessarily what you read online. If you're a nurse, talk to the doctors that specialize in internal medicine or infectious diseases. Get 2nd and 3rd opinions. And stop listening to people online with their anecdotal stories about vaccine illnesses or effects that may not even be true at all.",2021-11-20 3:38

"**1.  There's really no point in debating this with you if you refuse to recognize the institutional failings that are massively inflating the cost of education for students today, particularly for medical school students.** -  I thought we are having a discussion.  No need to direct such an attack on me  **2.  For students who aren't born rich, becoming a doctor should not come down to a binary choice of ""take on hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt or don't become a doctor.""  Not having the money on hand to pay for medical school isn't some indication of poor choices or moral failings that would warrant punishment.** -  I've never made this about moral failing.  I am presenting this issue as an adult making an important, life changing decision about a career choice.  These decisions have benefits and consequences.  The price of medical school was not hidden from your wife.  She was told very clearly how much she will owe before she even started the first day of school.  She decided to go into it.   -  You don't need to be born rich to go to medical school.  I am a newish graduate myself.  I paid off my med school on my own after I started working.  Most of my classmates paid off of theirs just fine.  We just kept our expenses low and chose a cheaper med school.  My residency colleagues who went to private ones and owed $500,000 probably didn't pay it off yet.  That's their choice.  One can take on debt that is reasonable to his/her financial situation.  State schools are much cheaper and reasonably priced than private schools.  Let's not make all medical school debt the same. -  You're making a straw man argument that somehow I'm supporting the notion that only rich people get to become doctors.  No.  All I'm saying is that if you can't afford the expensive private ones, don't go to that one.  Choose a cheaper option.  If your calling to medicine is so strong that you decide to go regardless of the cost, well, then pay the price.  **3. The federal government mandates that our young doctors spend 3-7 years in residency, forces them to take a well-below-market salary, and further punishes those among them who weren't born rich by refusing to toll the accumulation of interest on federally-held loans. If you care about fairness so much, how is that fair?**  -  Residency hours suck.  You work a lot for little pay.  If you don't like it, fight to change that.  I have nothing against that fight.  I think it's great that you wish to fight that fight.  Just don't conflate these two issues together.  You can ask for your wife to get paid more without having her debt forgiven.  Again, I'm in support of your wife receiving hazard pay.  **4.  Again, less than $400B of the $2.2 trillion stimulus actually went to the people** -  I don't support bailout of the companies either.  Just because that happened doesn't mean I should turn around and say ""free money for everyone.""

my question is was it normal that she got a cold so soon after the dose? because when she went to the vaz site she didn't have any symptom, maybe it happened because she had the flu in incubation period and then the vaccine made it instantly functional? or something like that idk lol

"Can I just say - as someone who experienced some pretty rough nerve side effects from my first Moderna dose in Feb, and was terrified, I came to this group to get a better understanding of what was going on and to find others with my similar experience. Talking to other people about what they experienced was truly helpful to understand how people coped physically and mentally. We’re all at about our wits end from the last year and a half with this thing - so the need to feel a sense of community feels stronger than ever now. This used to be how covidvaccinated felt. Empathetic, supportive, etc. 

Somewhere along the line - that changed. 

Now I see people ask just general questions - and it feels like the responders are attacking OP. 

Woman  comes asking about having a longer period post vax and people responding with comments about how she won’t be able to have children, etc. What?! Why can’t it just be that her body is likely inflamed and sending her encouraging words? And maybe encourage her to see her physicians?

People complaining of having some nerve/joint pain - and people commenting about how them getting vaccinated gave them MS or fibromyalgia and their cytokines will be messed up forever. WHAT?! Why can’t it possibly be nerve irritation and you send that person well wishes and maybe what worked for you if you ran into that same side effect?

Please understand that people with questions or concerns about side effects can often be in a vulnerable state - anxious, in pain, etc and the LAST thing people need is inflammatory statements. If you don’t know why someone is reacting how they are - Just say you don’t know and try to be more compassionate. I think this thread could use a little more empathy and a little less gaslighting and doomsday stuff.

"We got vaccinated in Germany in June with Moderna and were traveling Spain for the last two months. No booster was available when we started traveling nor was it available in Spain for our age group during our stay.

About 2-1/2 Weeks ago we suffered from a Covid infection with high fever and medium symptoms, Spanish hospital did not run a PCR type test though. We both tested positive and got symptoms and isolated in hotel for more than a week. Self tests stopped being positive after about 8-9 days.

Having recovered now and being on our way back through France, I was denied access to restaurants yesterday because my Vaccination is 7 Months old now (hers is a bit newer and still accepted).

I do not want to suffer restrictions in everyday life because I am not boosters - but I am not sure if it makes any sense to get vaccinated again just days after recovering from a Covid infection (and being fully vaccinated in the first place).

Also, the second shot Moderna gave me 4 days of fever with up to 40 degrees Celsius temperature. The infection ""just"" gave me 39 degrees Celsius fever. I am afraid my immune system will go crazy if I get a booster now.

The fact of the matter is, masks suck in a way regular clothing doesn't, which is why the world as a whole wasn't already clothing faces. They're stifling and they make it more frustrating for two people to communicate both by dulling speech and by obscuring the face which is an important tool in human interaction.

"First, how long will that extra pay last?  It's sure as shit not going to last the 20 years it'll likely take to satisfy my wife's debt payments.

Second, you're using a flawed ""fairness"" argument.  This isn't a zero sum game.  My wife is a resident, which means that she's getting paid significantly less than many nurses in the hospital.  As a surgical resident, her hourly rate breaks down to ~$12/hour.  Every resident in the country is significantly underpaid compared to the value they generate.  If we're going to inject the ""fairness"" argument, how is it fair that, despite making less than many nurses, she isn't eligible for the hazard pay nurses can receive as she's technically not an employee of her hospital?    Trying to reduce everything to what's completely and totally ""fair"" is an excuse for inaction.  The perfect need not be the enemy of the good.  Forgiving medical school student loan debt for frontline healthcare workers would be a good, positive thing - so let's do it.  Again, it's not a zero sum game.

No, but if you take all the measures, it will reduce the odds of the person catching it or spreading it.

"M30 (UK).

Dealing with chronic epididymitis for 2 years now (started shortly after taking my 2nd COVID vaccine in June 2021 (AstraZeneca in the UK). Was 27 at the time, completely healthy prior to that and no lifestyle changes either. My right testicle swelled up 2 weeks after my 2nd dose.

\- Been to 4 different urologists – no help but gas lightning me and sending me away on antibiotics. Last one is the only one who acknowledged it’s a vaccine injury, that he’s seen a lot of patients with male genital problems coming to him and that he was threatened he’d lose his job if he spoke against the vaccine.

\- Done several urine/semen culture tests - negative for STD's or UTI.

\- Done 5 ultrasounds (in different countries) - none of which showing any hydrocele, varicocele, cysts or tumours. Last one didn't even show inflammation, despite my right testicle being swollen.

\- Done 2 one-month courses of antibiotics - Ofloxacin in June 2022 and Bactrim + Tamsulosin February 2023 (as the last urologist I saw checked my prostate and diagnosed me with prostatitis). Did 3 months of amitriptyline - no relief.

\- Tried supplements - Turmeric, Quercetin, CoQ10, Saw Palmetto, Nattokinase - no help. Been fasting for 2 years now as well (23:1), no change.

\- Done pelvic floor stretches in the case of CPPS - no relief.

\- Sperm count test in August 2021 - extremely low levels. I was born with undescended testicles and had surgery very late (when I was 3-4), which could've contributed to that. It never caused me any pain or problems all my life, though. Possible correlation between that surgery and the vaccine ""hitting"" me down there, but no urologists have given any answers.

Symptoms: pain and swelling in the right testicle (especially after ejaculation), as well as redness and itching. My right testicle is hard as a rock and has a lump at the bottom, despite tumor marker tests being negative and none of the 5 ultrasounds seeing anything.

I caught COVID in December 2022 and left testicle also inflamed and has remained that way since then. It is surface level pain/itchiness only - no dull or constant one. The pain is relieved after hot showers. The redness and itching are only triggered during the process of sex and masturbation. After that they subside. Scratching helps quite a lot. It almost mimics allergic reaction, but anti-histamines are not helping.

Recently did ANA test and came positive for autoimmune antibodies(1:320, homogeneous). ENA/ds-DNA tests ruled out any of the major syndromes and negative ANCA ruled out vasculitis. My CRP is elevated too (14).. IGG (G, A & M) are within normal levels. Ferritin is high 345 ug/L \[24.0 - 336.0\]. I had COVID while doing it (December 2022) and I also had positive antismooth muscle antibodies at that time too. That one went to negative after re-testing a few months later, but the ANA has remained the same (1:320).

The only thing left that I can think of is potential autoimmune orchitis, but I believe that would've been accompanied by a positive ANCA too.

My GP refuses to send me to a rheumatologist as they say it's a urology matter. Yet after 4 urologists visits, they are all clueless and provide no advice despite sending me away on antibiotics.

Any idea on what to do? I am regularly posting this, because I’ve exhausted all options and desperately hope some day a comment will pop that someone’s figured it.

Many thanks.",2023-07-22 21:40

He also said said “I am required to recommend the covid vaccine to pregnant women” and when I asked him to write me a note to be exempt from the vaccine he said “I can’t go over the CDC.” So weird.

Regarding both mumps and regular measles, they ran through the neighborhood when I was in early elementary school, but I never displayed any signs of any illness.  I was a long-awaited only child and my parents were hyper vigilant about monitoring my health.   They expected me to come down with one or another, and I myself vividly recall waiting to get mumps; two children I played with constantly and rode with in a car to and from school did.  Was I the equivalent of a non-transmitting Typhoid Mary?  Who knows. The fact that I had paucisymptomatic Covid--only those peculiar purplish pink toes, but no fever or sniffles-might suggest so.  Getting an MMR shot was the most expeditious way of addressing the present issue, and, at least in my locale in Arizona, there was no shortage of the vaccine.  Will I do more?

Moreover, according to Hebrew University researchers who advise the government, around 90% of newly infected people over the age of 50 are fully vaccinated.""* So the vaccine IS HELPING, these statistics PROVE THAT, but they also prove that the Delta Variant is not to be taken lightly and that a new vaccine MUST be developed to combat this deadly mutation.",2021-08-01 21:29

"This wasn't a vaccine given to all children/teens until 2005, so most people 40+ did not get this vaccine. Exceptions might be adults who went into the military or went to live in college dorms starting in the late 90s.  I'm sure some adults have went back to get it, but it's typically not recommended for adults unless they have certain risk factors. So, I think people have to pay for it out of pocket if they get it as an adult. I could be wrong, though! I'd be interested to hear if it is a free and easy vaccine to get because it's a vaccine I never received.

"Hypothetically, lets say a doctor can save 100 people per day who already have COVID, but can save 0 per day if they themselves get COVID, and they will not get COVID if they have a mask. If there is only one mask left, I would say give the mask to the doctor over just some rando on the street.   You might say this is an emotional appeal, but it is not. It is a real world instantiation of the trolley problem. Give the mask to the doctor, it saves 100 lives. Give the mask to some guy and it saves 1 life. Arguing that the masks should have been given to everyone is great, but we simply did not have enough because manufacturing lagged behind demand.  When there is only one mask, you have to prioritize who gets them.   In reality, we should have had more masks. When the WHO announced that the spread in china constituted an epidemic of international concern, the US government should have gone to 3m and told them to make masks. Make as many as you want and we will pay for them. If they refuse, Defense Production Act their asses. This should have happened in January or Feburary, not mid March. This allows a few weeks to ramp up production in time for the big spike in March. Instead, the DPA was invoked in mid march, and we had suitable mask supply in early to mid April. To compensate for this delay, the CDC people Trolley-Problem-ed the recommendations to allow doctors to save more lives. This is for the good of everyone, not me.

Depending on definition, ""controlled"" spread would be either declining cases, flat cases, or in the most loose definition, linearly-increasing cases. As soon as you have exponential growth from a sizeable base, that's uncontrolled.   Masks help lower the exponent value, but they don't stop it. In the summer, it was probably enough: assume that the R0 in the summer is 1.3, and masks reduced it by .2, and other measures reduced it by .2, and boom, now you're at an Rt of .9. Slow decline in new cases over time.  In the winter, the R0 is higher. Maybe it's 1.5 now. All of a sudden, the same things that worked in the summer result in an Rt of 1.1 - which is growth. Way better than an Rt of 1.5 (e.g., what we see in the the Dakotas), but still exponential growth that at some point may overwhelm the system.",2020-11-11 18:20

I dont like the spike protein and I didnt create it. I guess I’ll also mention that the “vaccines” are killing people, ruining our dna, and planting nanotechnology in our bodies. Im against this because it is clearly a depopulation program meant to enslave and destroy humanity. That is literally the truth whether u want to believe it or not. You can find every shred of evidence on the internet because they tell you before they do it. That’s what satanists do. Its called informed consent.

"M29.

Dealing with chronic epididymitis for 2 years now after it started shortly after taking my 2nd COVID vaccine in June 2021 (AstraZeneca in the UK). Was 27 at the time, completely healthy prior to that and no lifestyle changes around that time either. AZ was quickly pulled off the UK market - no wonder since I am hard evidence of the devastating effects it can have on one's body.

\- Been to 4 different urologists, including private ones and in different countries - none of which being able to help despite sending me away on antibiotics.

\- Done several urine/semen culture tests - negative for STD's (been with the same partner for 12 years now anyway, so I knew it wouldn't be a bacterial cause even before doing them).

\- Done five ultrasounds - again in private hospitals and in different countries - none of which showing any hydrocele, varicocele, cysts or tumors. Heck, the last one didn't even show inflammation, despite my right testicle being swollen.

\- Done 2 one-month courses of antibiotics - Ofloxacin in June 2022 and Bactrim + Tamsulosin February 2023 (as the last urologist I saw checked my prostate and diagnosed me with prostatitis). Neither of the antibiotics did anything, besides Bactrim further messing up my (already) fatty liver. Did 3 months of amitriptyline as well - no relief.

\- Done multiple supplements - Turmeric, Quercetin, CoQ10, Saw Palmetto, Nattokinase - no help.

\- Done pelvic floor stretches - no relief.

\- Sperm count test in August 2021 - extremely low levels. I was born with undescended testicles and had surgery very late (when I was 3-4), which could've contributed to that. It never caused me any pain or problems all my life, though. There could be correlation between that surgery and the vaccine ""hitting"" me down there, but none of the urologists could provide any answers.

Symptoms include pain and swelling in the right testicle (especially after ejaculation), as well as redness and itching. I caught COVID in December 2022 and left testicle also inflamed and has remained that way since then. Seems to be surface level pain and no dull or constant one. Only thing that relieves it are hot showers.

Recently did ana ANA test and came positive for something autoimmune going on (1:320, homogeneous). Further ENA/ds-DNA tests ruled out any of the major diseases and negative ANCA ruled out vasculitis. The only thing left that I can think of is potential autoimmune orchitis.

Any idea on what to do? I am in pain every day and filled with constant regret over taking the vaccine.

Many thanks.",2023-06-18 20:52

"Throwaway cause I'm a paranoid person.  I know it is ranty and I am posting mainly regarding the virus and health protacols i just like to give detail, i apologize, its just i'm constantly told ""this is just how it is"" or such loads of crap.  I work in a town that consists of a large elderly retirement community complex, multiple smaller ones, and middle class/rich people, however the store i work at is independently owned so there is no corporate or HR departments and it is also a monopoly for the area as the nearest grocery store is about 20 minutes away in a town no one wants to travel to or cannot travel to, so as expected his prices are generally unfair, the product is often bad, beaten to a pulp or put on discount months after expiration date hits.  Thankfully we have a good supply of gloves, however there are no masks provided or hand sanitizer, someone stole the tiny little bottle for customers in one of our departments already and when i say no one is getting any i mean no one, cashiers had a few tiny bottles they could scrounge up from home and that is it  I wore a mask I had gotten, just a basic blue/white mask and all i got told all day by so many people, coworkers and customers alike, ""that doesn't work you know!"" and a few ignorant, racist remarks about china making the masks. I read that it doesn't help not getting infected, but it helps not spreading it so I just wanted to be responsible about this since i work with food all day, but this is the reception i get for trying to be safe.  Cashiers and Stocking aren't asked or made to wear gloves, cashiers are touching peoples fruits and veggies with their bare hands and again without any sanitizer for themselves to use.  The owner also is doing what I knew he was going to do and this is what i was told he said, ""let people buy what they want"", you don't have to think for a split second how that went for us.  No people limit either, packed to the brim, old people, children, disabled. I know other stores are doing hours just for the elderly and vulnerable, that conversation isn't even a whisper in the head here.  I'm worried about getting it myself, i'm young and in pretty good health, but that doesn't mean i shouldn't be afraid too. If I could even get N95s I was told it might be better not to wear it out anyways with people being insane and hoarding things, its a good point, but i HAVE to go to this job so I should have proper masks too.  I could go on for a whole 500 page book on my experience at this place, but I want to try and stay focused on relating to the virus outbreak and health safety.

"The only way we can even get close to predicting the seasonal flu is because it hits China first. We're still not even very good at predicting it like that.  How are we able to work fast enough to stop the viruses when they mutate faster? This is like the problem we're starting to run into with antibiotics, except it can actually be helped in that case if people would finish all of the treatment.   My point with the money is that if they make vaccines that just force the virus to mutate and spread again, they can keep making more vaccines to keep making more money until it reaches a breaking point. Even with a basic 4 year degree in biology you would learn that vaccines are not foolproof and the viruses will adapt.

"Not saying we should not also be giving hazard pay to minimum wage workers. but the risks of say a grocery worker are not the same. Yes, they're facing the public, but they're encountering a 1-2% chance of facing a coronavirus patient each time, and for the most part at some distance, and not the most severe cases.  Medical professionals are coming into close contact with 100% chance of coronavirus patients, doing procedures that directly spray fluids and virus particles in the air, and face the most severe cases with the highest viral loads, and are also getting the highest exposures to a disease where the viral loads hhave a significant impact on how severe it is.  There's a reason why medical professionals represent like 10-20% of the deaths in every country - and you don't see a similar percentage of grocery store workers getting taken down.\  It is a considerably higher risk.  (i.e. it's the difference between the risk taken by say, a contractor sent to Iraq to cook up meals in the barracks, vs. soldiers sent out to directly fight insurgents - (yes, both are put in to a situation where they're at risk of harm, but the risks are considerably higher for the latter).",2020-05-06 17:42

"Inactivated virus vaccines are the type of vaccine that I have taken my whole life, I believe they have been around since we started taking vaccines.  

To my surprise yesterday I was reading about covid vaccines in China and all five of the vaccines they use are inactivated virus.

With the introduction and role out of the new Mrna vaccines I kind of assumed the reason we (the us) were using these new types of vaccines is that we weren't able to make the old kind or maybe the new ones are better, which is still what I assume.

Well now that I know it's possible to make the ""old trusted"" type I dont understand why the US still doesn't have an inactivated virus option. I do believe a good amount of the hesitancy of getting vaccinated against covid is solely around Mrna.

I'd appreciate any thoughts around this topic which I haven't found discussed.

"UPDATE: I ended up applying for the religious exemption waiver. Despite my lawyer discouraging me from it, I got approved. \~6 months after the medical exam I got my green card.

**UPDATE 2: Before messaging me with questions, please read below.**  
People regularly reach out to me asking questions about the waiver. If you choose to apply, your lawyer will ask you to write about your religious beliefs and reasoning to not want to get the vaccine. You will write about your experience in a form of a letter based on the prompts they give you.  
This waiver is to prove you are against **ALL vaccines**, not just COVID vaccine. However, they didn't turn me away due to having gotten vaccines as a kid. If you have gotten vaccines previously (due to not having a choice as a kid, or before you adopted a new religion, etc.), you can **explain all that in the letter**.  
You pay the waiver fee + the lawyer fee (which in my case was about **$1900 total**), your lawyer does the rest and lets you know if you’ve been approved. It took about **2 months** for it to get approved since the application date and no, I didn't have to ask to expedite the process.

Im in the process of getting my GC and USCIS sent me a letter saying I have to be seen my a civil surgeon to confirm my medical history or something like that. Only in the end of this long letter is says that the surgeon can only confirm my visit if I'm covid-19 vaxxed. It seems like the whole point of this letter is to force me to get vaxxed which I find crazy. I'm a lawful resident and I literally cannot get a GC unless I get the vaccine.

"Hello everyone! This is my first time posting here, so I’ll preface the point of my post by saying that I am very much pro-science, and overall entirely sick of anti-vaxxers and their nonsense. I recently came across a story (shared by vaccine-skeptical relatives) that I’d like to be able to explain, if only to help nudge them in a more science-based direction. The only problem is that the only sources I’ve found that discuss this incident in any real detail appear to be anti-vaxxers who treat the story as another “smoking gun” that proves that certain vaccines can cause autism. 

The story comes courtesy of Brenda and David McDowell, who claim that on June 25, 2007, their three triplets received a routine pneumococcal vaccine. Supposedly “All three children regressed into autism within hours of vaccination. The triplets were diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis. A geneticist explained that the chance to this happening to 2 of our triplets would be 1 in 4 million. It happened to all 3. It is not genetic.”

Since then, this family has apparently been featured on anti-vax “documentaries” like *Vaxxed 2* (I wouldn’t know, I never wasted my time watching it). Now obviously there are some things that are immediately wrong with the way the story is being presented—one doesn’t “regress” into autism, for one thing—but I haven’t been able to find any solid information to fully debunk the story or demonstrate that other factors were almost certainly at play. Any information I *have* found is pretty much exclusively skewed to the anti-vax narrative, which is ultimately why I’m here looking for whatever it is I seem to be missing.

I see COVID as a bit worse than flu but mostly on par now.  But have done flu shots since the late 90s.  I’m curious if they are handling them in a way equivalent to flu shots. As that is more what is appropriate for an illness.  Getting sick is a nuisance even if it doesn’t kill you or cause long COVID.  And productivity wise a vaccine is definitely cheaper than being out for 2 weeks.  That’s why I’ve been so confused by the policy toward covid shots.  Like isn’t it better to not have to deal with being sick?  It’s not like the shots have serious side effects compared to Covid itself….,2025-09-18 1:01

"Pretty sure that happened to me. I was in immense pain every day so I finally started taking the pain meds I was prescribed more regularly. Then I started taking two at a time because one wasn’t doing anything anymore at all. It was all I could do for pain relief. I still begged for other pain medication alternatives but because of kidney problems everything other than opioids was quickly dismissed by my doctor. I took the maximum of 8 tablets a day at some point and it just wasn‘t doing much. I was still suffering. It had helped initially and it did seem to numb the pain for a little while but not completely.  In the end I went to therapy and said I need to learn how to manage this pain because I couldn’t do this anymore. I didn’t want to get out of bed anymore at all. And being in bed all day made the pain even worse.   My therapist suggested a bunch of techniques I felt were idiotic. Like charting every hour how I felt and what my pain level was and how many pain meds I had taken. But I started doing it. It showed me how much of a habit it had become - I thought I only took the medication when the pain was bad. Tracking it showed me quickly that without noticing I took them within the same hour every day. Of course that’s partly because it only lasts so long so the pain will start up again at the same time but I didn’t even take them the same time every morning (I tried to last as long as possible every morning without taking anything). And then she asked I count the total number of pain meds I take every week. And try to reduce it just by a little every week. And find ways to distract myself. Instead of sitting at work all day, I should go to for a walk when the pain became unbearable. I should go get a glass of water and talk to colleagues in the kitchen. Anything to distract myself from the pain. I thought it would be pointless - the pain was so bad there was no way I could go with less pain medication.  Within two weeks I was down to 2 pain meds a day. Within 3 weeks I was completely off. I had started taking CBD oil to help with the pain, I had started going for more walks and set meetings spread throughout my day instead all at once. So I was constantly moving around and changing my day up. I had also bought capsicum and cbd creme. Distraction was important I learned and often very hard to achieve. Stress was the worst. My therapist let me message her whenever I needed. So when it got bad or when I was stressed I sent her a message and got a response that calmed me down or gave me new ideas on how to distract myself. I suddenly was also distracted by the side effects from withdrawals which I now think may have even helped. Withdrawals felt better than the pain. Though it was hard not being able to sleep at times. The CBD helped a bit with that after a while.   Some days were so horrible that I sent my therapist a message one day after 3 weeks of being clean that if it meant I needed to go through this pain constantly now then life isn’t worth living. So she said to take a pill. Her allowing me to do so made me feel better about my need to take one. So much that I lasted another day without one. The next day I caved because it became unbearable. But I only took one at a time and two total. It became bearable again after a few days and I stopped taking them again.   I was able to start doing sports more regularly again which in turn also reduced my pain.  Nowadays I go weeks without taking any pain medication. Which is good because my doctor changed and my new one won‘t prescribe me unlimited opioids anymore (my previous doctor had even stopped asking and I simply needed to click a button online to get a new prescription sent to the pharmacy). She doesn’t understand the level of pain I sometimes go through and it scares me to think what would have happened to me if I had her before I had been able to reduce my intake. I had no way of dealing with the pain before - it was unbearable. But she also has a point. Ideally I would have a doctor at a middle ground between the two. One who understands I need pain relief but also one that pays attention and ensures I don‘t end up completely addicted.  The problem with opioids is that you need increasingly larger doses to do the same job. If you fully rely on them you need more and more to get the same pain relief you used to get from a single dose. I now am back to being able to get relief from the smallest dose but back then it didn’t do even a dent.",2020-03-24 9:39

IMO, once a human is injected with a vaccine, there is no way to control what the immune response of that human will be.  We are each our own chemistry experiment.

I know of a pediatrician married to a pharmacist who apparently won't allow his teenage daughter to be vaccinated.  According to what I've read, ""Alopecia areata (AA) is a common, non-scaring form of hair loss caused by **immune-mediated attack of the hair follicle.**""  Vaccines ""**trigger an immune response within the body**"".  Given that your AA occurred a few weeks after vaccination, once your immune response kicked in, anyone (^(with at least average intelligence but who are not liable for anything)) would suspect a link.  Does your medical team tell you why there is no link?  Pursuing this will likely not help you, but it is interesting.  Are you on any other medications, particularly those that affect the immune system?   Have you looked into vitamin b6?

His mother also tested positive as well. Neither of them are vaccinated. 


Now that i’m officially out of the 10 day incubation period, I’m just so impressed by this vaccine. Even with only the first dose I was protected.

So they are mandating a vaccine that’s not useful?  Thanks for making my point.  They shouldn’t look at any of that. They should do a prospective study. But since they aren’t I can look at cases in general in a highly vaccinated country to make judgements.   Teasing out vaccinated versus unvaccinated is difficult and requires specialized study.

Not many folks have got the shot, and some of those have got the second while millions havent even sniffed the first one.  Hopefully biden gets things in order, as its clearly come to light that trump not only didnt really care about the pandemic ( he and his crew rarely wore masks and after he got a vaccine or cutting edge stem cell super shot it emboldened him further to not wear or do anything about it ) there was no plan whatsoever to fix the issue.  Scary to think someone in charge of one of the biggest countries and powers in the world not only didnt have a plan, but didnt care about people straight up dying when he ultimately could have done things to prevent how bad its got.

So remember that this sub isnt reflective of the wider vaccination programmes going on. Having some temporary side effects is way better in the long run than potentially dying from Covid. 

Personally, 30M. Had 1st dose of Astrazeneca in March and the 2nd dose today. I was naturally anxious about the whole blood clot news, but as of yesterday there have only been 15 cases out of 9 million doses second doses (Source: MHRA), which is incredibly reassuring. Circa 1 in 600,000! And Covid itself has an 8x higher chance of giving clots - I personally have a relative whos only 20 years old with no health conditions, who caught Covid and developed clots in his lungs. Lastly, I remind myself that vaccines are ultimately essential...as we cannot spend our lives locked inside forever.

If the breakthrough rate is higher it will still trend to zero just slower, but not by much. (using 15% 3 infections would be 0.3375%)  The issue is this holds for vaccinated individuals, unvaccinated individuals can be seen as resetting the chain starting back up at 5-10% breakthrough.

"Hey everyone! 

I got a small cut abroad a few days ago in which street dirt might have gone in. Although the cut was low risk, as it had been 19 years since my last tetanus toxoid vaccinations (as a child), I decided to get the vaccine within 24h of the occurrance on the advice of a doctor.

Within 24h I got a fever, with a peak of 101.8F (38.8C - do note the temperature and humidity here is very high), which has now decreased a bit to 100.6F / 38.1C after around 36 hours of fever onset. For the rest not feeling great at all (headache, muscle aches, tiredness, general discomfort). For the rest no local reactions at all (no swelling/rash/redness on vaccine location, no muscle pain on the vaccinated arm) 

Is this a normal reaction to the TT vax and how was your experience with it? For example, my reaction to the covid vaccines was much milder.

Thanks!",2025-08-01 22:10

"Excuse me but what? The curve has most certainly NOT flattened. It was for a moment yes but just look at that pretty graph out right now and you'll see something that says otherwise.  And you're right, people panicking about a disease is correct and not how it should go. What would have solved that? Probably a pandemic response team and a government that didn't politicize a global pandemic.   The orders continue because it is a very real threat. Swine flue itself killed 250k people GLOBALLY. Corona Virus in the last 5 months? Documented at almost half a million. **And that's not including the numbers other countries have fudged and the deaths that were caused by covid-19 but atteibuted as pneumonia.**  And cool. Young healthy people survive the disease. But fuck everyone else who is at high risk right? Like those young people who suffer asthma? Or those kids who's parents are 45+ and could die? Or those people who are 50+, still contribute to society and have much to offer and deserve to live just as much as 'young healthy people' right?  Final statement: Disease panic is dangerous yes. But we can't just go around pretending that pandemics never exist and we as a modern society won't succumb to disease. Had people taken it seriously from the start, had we as a society already developed the concept of wearing masks as not a social stigma but as just a part of life, had a competent government immediately tackled issues and quelled the populace instead of politicizing death and disease, I can guarantee we'd be in a better place. Wearing masks, social distancing and washing hands is not the issue or a moot practice, it's honestly the best we have world wide and the fact that so many in the country can't even be adults about such a simple concept is why we are where we are.

"You're assuming childhood vaccines are pure.  None of the ones currently used in the US, except for one small secondary control group in an HPV vaccine trial, was ever tested for safety using a saline placebo. They test against other vaccines, that were tested against other vaccines. Or they test against a solution of the ""inactive"" ingredients, which contains adjuvants, preservatives, and everything else except the actual dead or weakened virus or bacteria. When the adverse effect profiles come out basically the same, the new vaccine is considered ""safe"" because the placebo has already been dubbed ""safe.""  Back in the 1970s and 1980s, vaccine manufacturers were being sued by parents of vaccine-injured children so often--and losing--that they threatened to stop making certain vaccines. Instead of insisting the corporations make their products safer (or go ahead and pull them off the market), Ronald Reagan and Congress granted the manufacturers freedom from liability for vaccine injuries starting in 1986-87. That's where the ""vaccine court"" and VAERS came from.  With no more liability for faulty products, how motivated do you think the pharma companies are to make safer products? 🤔 Instead, they make more and more vaccines for milder and milder diseases, and lobby state legislatures to mandate those vaccines for schoolchildren--a guaranteed market.",2024-12-12 19:37

They would have died anyway.  The only purpose of a ventilator is to let them hang on a little longer in hopes of recovery.  Edit:  Just to explain this fallacy a little deeper because I see it all the time, especially in conservatives-  Look up the correlation with ice cream sales and murder rates.  The correlation is extremely high.  When ice cream sales go up, so does murder.  Does that mean ice cream sales cause murder?  Absolutely not, it means there's some third variable affecting both.  In the case of ice cream and murder, that factor is warm weather.  The same is true here.

"I have asthma too. I was reading today about steroid inhalers. Bit worried as at the moment I’m very mucusy and can’t get it up so i’m using my clenil but apparently the use of the steroid inhalers is working against people with the virus because although the virus causes the immune system to go into overdrive and kill virus + healthy cells, the steroids work to stop the immune response so we don’t get an attack. Apparently when it is used for 2-3 weeks during the virus it causes it to be very severe.   But they also recommend continuing it if you have it.  So I really am just not sure what I’m doing atm. If I take it i’m less immune so could catch it easier..bjt would be comfortable before I get it. If I don’t take it..asthma attacks will be bad and the mucus will be bad enough I can’t breathe anyway and then if i get it I will still not be able to breathe.

">Mr. Kennedy says the new policy will not affect flu shots, but the future of Covid boosters is now in doubt. Andrew Nixon, the department spokesman, said that because so many people have been infected and now have immunity to Covid, new studies are required.  >“As we’ve said before, trials from four years ago conducted in people without natural immunity no longer suffice,” he said. “A four-year-old trial is also not a blank check for new vaccines each year without clinical trial data, unlike the flu shot, which has been tried and tested for more than 80 years. The public deserves transparency and gold-standard science — especially with evolving products.”  This is pretty reasonable. A therapeutic that was approved for a novel virus based on data collected in a largely naïve population probably should be retested with gold-standard trials in a population with widespread exposure to show it is still effective in this context.  Whether such a trial should be paid for by the manufacturer or by the NIH is open for debate, but re-examining the efficacy of these vaccines seems an important scientific question and good practice for evidence-based medicine.",2025-05-02 8:14

"I mean... according to the CDC, 92.5% of children are vaccinated with 3 doses of IPV by age 24 months. In 2010 a study was completed that indicated that more than 79% of all adults 20-49 in the US have antibodies to poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, indicating that childhood vaccine immune memory persists for decades.   Given these facts, and then given the massive problem we had when CoV first entered the US, wouldn't you think that the initial response would have been better? IE if having IPV vaccination was more effective than the new CoV vaccines, wouldn't we have seen very little severe response initially, instead of the protection we saw with the mRNA vaccines?   It's interesting preliminary data, but this was a self-reported study of like ~250 people, none of which got severe disease (read - hospitalized), whose only method for reporting disease severity was just in days of 'symptoms'. The authors themselves indicate larger studies need to be conducted.   It's definitely cool to think about, and it could lead to better outcomes as we examine the RDRP protein as a target, but I think it's probably a reach to say that the IPV (edit to add: Or OPV Priming with IPV) is much more effective against covid than covid vaccines themselves.",2024-07-03 2:45

"So I'm torn between all of this. At first, I was very adamant on believing the numbers and not believing that they were being inflated until my grandmother was rushed to the ER and we were told she was positive for ""a touch of covid"". Never developed any symptoms and upon being released a week later, we immediately got her tested because the hospital 100% would not do a second test. Our main concern was that she had to be switched to a covid positive dialysis center and that would expose her to it. When they gave us her discharge papers, nothing on there about covid, yet when we all got tested we were given packets of what to do if we came back positive. Her first outside test came back negative and we were told she needed two negatives to return to her normal dialysis facility, so we immediately got her tested again. Thankfully that came back negative as well, so we were able to get her back in after only one visit to the covid positive center. I'd love to get her an antibody test to find out if she ever actually had it or if it was a ""false positive"".        Experiencing that first hand, it's hard not to think that hospitals are doing this for the extra money which in turn is driving the numbers up. If they would take advantage of an old lady coming in with no memory and not allowed to have any family around, why wouldn't they take advantage of a death? I'm not saying it's all ill tendencies, but I am saying that hospitals are hurting for money and a lot of CEOs see this as an opportunity to make some of that back. The hospital wouldn't retest her because they would have to forfeit the $13,000. In PA they removed a few hundred positives shortly into the pandemic and that was kind of proof that there was things like this going on.  Edit: not sure why my text comes out like this? Lol.

Three/four days into this regimen the heavy bleeding became spotting; the bleeding has now finally stopped. I am beyond relieved that it finally has. 

Current side effects experienced: some hot flashes, some vaginal dryness. No notable mood swings, insomnia, acne, or other common side effects. They don't think I'll be on this long enough to require bone density monitoring, but they're willing to reevaluate in a month. They do not expect me to be on this longer than a month. They do not expect long-term menstrual problems or ovulation/uterine problems from either the original side effects or this course of treatment. They have advised me to continue with the iron supplementation for the time being. They do not recommend I receive the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.

"I suffered from extreme health anxiety for years, but I still managed to convince myself to get my shots with the Pfizer vaccine. After spending too much time on this subreddit and other platforms I got extremely and irrationally scared of the possible side effect, causing me to have a major panic attack at the vaccination site. 
Having received both my Pfizer shots, I can tell you that it was nothing but a good experience. I hope people realise that this subreddit isn’t representative of the general population. People with bad experiences tend to be more vocal about them. Besides, please don’t trust the internet, both good and bad experiences could be made up to serve some political agenda. In most cases there’s no way of knowing. Do your own research using peer reviewed scientific papers, ask your doctor and talk to friends/family who got the vaccine. 

My experience as a 23 year old female was as followed:

1st shot
Day of the shot: sore arm (got progressively worse throughout the day, but manageable) 
Second day: sore arm (but less so than the day before), tired 
Third day: completely back to normal 

2nd shot 
Day of the shot: sore arm (wasn’t as bad as it was after my first shot)
Second day: sore arm remained, tired
Third day: completely back to normal 

Both my parents and most of my friends had the same experience as me. Some got worse side affects, like a headache and raised temperature. But for all of them the side affects were gone within 48hours after receiving the shots.

"Want to clarify that I'm not anti vaxx. I've had 3 doses of the vaccine but am experiencing a lot of issues and am trying to figure out why they may be happening

I got my first COVID- 19 booster dose in september. I got the updated Moderna and had the usual side effects of fever and weakness which eventually subsided after a week or so. Fast forward to early November, I noticed that my skin started to become really dry. Seeing how it was becoming colder, I attributed it to the changing weather since it usually happens to me in the winters (I lived in India for 19 years and came to the UK for uni in the first quarter of 2021). I noticed that my eyelids were also becoming red and dry which was odd but I let it slide. Around the 19th november, my eyes began to seriously swell up and become extremely red and dry. I have never really had any allergies or skin conditions so I was really confused as I couldn't tell why it was happening. My eyelids and undereyes were bright red. I visited the A&E where I was told it looked like contact dermatitis. The day after, I spoke to my GP over the phone and was told it seemed to be due to changes in the weather. Keep in mind that I have never had this problem my entire life. I was advised to stop wearing any makeup and put a mild steroid cream for a week on the affected areas along with having antihistamines. I mostly stayed inside this week and did what I was told. After a week, the swelling and redness almost fully cleared up. I started going out again and after a few days it was back. I spoke to my doctors back home and they were unable to tell me what exactly it could be. I stayed inside again until my skin cleared up. At this point, I was able to guess that stepping outside was causing this to happen, so I began to cover my eyes with glasses and a hood everytime I went outside. I realised that when I was covering my face when outside, I was able to avoid swelling, dryness, and redness for the most part. Recently (february 1), I went outside and did not wear my glasses for just a second when a light breeze hit my face. I immediately wore them right after. That night, I noticed a little swelling and redness under my eyes and the next day I woke up to swollen, red and dry eyes (skin) again. I've spoken to multiple doctors who have told me that it something outside is causing this to happen but are unable to guess why. One or two doctors said that it could be a side effect of the vaccine (i got the indian astrazeneca for my first two doses which temporarily affected my periods and made them more painful), but do not know how to treat it. I am also suspicious of it being a side effect of the vaccine because my eating patterns have remained the same (my diet is pretty healthy and I eat a good amount of fruit and veggies and exercise 4-5 times a week), i haven't really used any new or shady skin products/ makeup, and have never had this problem my whole life until 1.5 months after I got the vaccine.

If someone does everything right, and still gets fucked over anyways, it's tragic. If someone does everything wrong, gets warned of the consequences, and keeps doing it anyway, it's just naturally hard to feel sympathy for that, I think. Even when it's not covid related, some people just refuse to accept anyone could know more than them, and refuse to take important advice seriously.  I feel sympathy for people who do basic things like listen to experts and take precautions. I struggle to feel sympathy for people who fail the *bare minimum* of what's asked of them and suffer the consequences of their own actions as a result.",2020-10-14 15:45

"I'm not sure. I think end result is that it's because people are weak and impatient, but I think there might be more complicated reasoning as to why people got there in the first place. I'm by no means an apologist for these people, because there's no reason why someone can't do something so simple as wear a mask.  It seems that there's an inherent system of constructs that have led people and trained people up to care more about themselves than others. Some people might naturally be inclined to be narcissists, but I think a lot of people were taught to be shitty people by something whether it's the news, maybe some weird twisted teaching from an ignorant pastor in church, an ignorant parental upbringing, or cyclical societal/peer pressure from bad people.  It also doesn't help that our government officials and our damn baby-child of a president says and does the things he does.  It really does amaze me though just how bad it feels in our population(even though it might just be the crazy loud minority(?)...I really hope it's not as many people as it feels like that I see on the internet.)  I've been an advocate for a long time with the ideas that we were opening things way too early, that people lack any discipline or patience for inconvenience, and for wearing masks.  I have family and friends that have all spoken out on social media about how much they hate the inconveniences and that they're sick of masks; They just want to go back to the bars because they're bored (also posting pictures when places like Wisconsin opened up places with the ""thank god some people are smart enough to open, I couldn't take it any longer"", all while only being like mid/late April or whatever. People that went out shopping early on the morning of openings because they couldn't stand not being able to go on a shopping spree during a pandemic.   Meanwhile I'm over here rolling my eyes because people fail to internalize the facts that ***just because officials right now tell you you CAN do something...doesn't always mean you should just go do it or that it's safe to do it.*** People will look for any reason to stretch or break the rules to get away with things. A lot of people are impatient, lazy, and narcissistic. Wearing a mask and distancing is not hard. Not going out is not *that* hard when you look at what's on the line. People act like it's literally the apocalypse and that were gonna be fucked for like 5 years in isolation quarantine. A year of time is a blip that will suck but can go by real fast.

"**Abstract** - May 14, 2024 ____      As coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) becomes an endemic disease, the virus continues to evolve and become immunologically distinct from previous strains. Immune imprinting has raised concerns about bivalent mRNA vaccines containing both ancestral virus and Omicron variant. To increase efficacy against the predominant strains as of the second half of 2023, the updated vaccine formulation contained only the mRNA of XBB.1.5 sublineage. We conducted a multicenter, test-negative, case-control study to estimate XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine effectiveness (VE) and present the results of an interim analysis with data collected in November 2023. Patients who underwent COVID-19 testing at eight university hospitals were included and matched based on age (19-49, 50-64, and ≥65 years) and sex in a 1:1 ratio. VE was calculated using the adjusted odds ratio derived from multivariable logistic regression. Of the 992 patients included, 49 (5.3%) received the XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine at least 7 days before COVID-19 testing. Patients with COVID-19 (cases) were less likely to have received the XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine (case 3.5% vs. control 7.2%, p=0.019) and to have a history of COVID-19 within 6 months (2.2% vs. 4.6%, p=0.068). In contrast, patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be healthcare workers (8.2% vs. 3.0%, p=0.001) and to have chronic neurological diseases (16.7% vs. 11.9%, p=0.048). **The adjusted VE of the XBB.1.5 monovalent mRNA vaccine was 56.8% (95% confidence interval: 18.7-77.9%). XBB.1.5 monovalent mRNA vaccine provided significant protection against COVID-19 in the first one to two months after vaccination.**",2024-05-29 3:31

Blood clotting disorders are another problem people have had after the jabs. Again, you'd probably know by now.

I have glomerulonephritis and mononucleosis (from kidney I believe), which stopped bothering me about 9 years ago back in my childhood. It's a somewhat creepy disease combination and discussing it was kind of a taboo in my family due to painful memories of trying to heal me. One of the main symptoms I remember (and sometimes the only one occuring) is swelling of particular body parts, most often eyelids in the morning, and this stuff is supposed to be only the beginning. My parents were convinced that getting vaccinated is out of question for me as I had these two diseases and vaccine will damage my immune system and make it resurface or something. It sounded like gibberish, and my brother has the same diseases (but from lungs or something), he got vaccinated and it was fine for him.

This night I woke up at about 4 a.m. and noticed that my eyelids are somewhat swollen, reminding me of my forgotten diseases that I was warned against. Naturally, I was utterly terrified. The swelling stopped about five hours later, but I worry that it may return next morning and is a beginning of resurface process of the two diseases.

The sphere has a volume of **\~33** cubic feet  Now we social distance and increase our bubble to 6 feet... 6 feet will result in a volume of \~904 cubic feet. That means the virus has about 27 times more space to spread out.  So the virus load at 6 feet is only **\~3.6%** of thats it is when face hugging.  &#x200B;  Now combine them to calculate the result over improving the Mask to N95:   100% \* 79% (Cloth mask) > 21% \*  3.6% (Social Distance factor) -> **0.7665% Particles remaining**",2020-10-13 11:26

I've possibly had a reaction to the PEG in the vaccine. Have you or anyone else in NZ had help and if so what ,, ie immunosuppressant, steroids ?? Thanks",2022-05-12 21:11
"Why was there ever one?  There is literally no medical condition that would grant a ""mask exemption"".  People in their 90s have done intense (it actually sounds quite brutal to me given their age, so it's highly commendable!) physical exercise wearing one.  People with severe asthma and/or COPD have worn them during physical exercise. Perfectly fine.  Doctors/nurses have worn ones many times thicker for 18+ hours at a time for ***decades***.  There's even been reports of people with *one* lung wearing a mask during physical exercise and, believe it or not, ***they were entirely fine***.  Autism isn't an excuse either. If your autism is so severe that you *can't* wear a mask, you're probably not going out and about either. It's no different than the people feigning asthma claiming they can't wear a mask. Good news, you shouldn't even be here (in a public venue) because COVID will instantly kill you with how oxygen deprived you apparently are daily.",2020-11-13 0:47
"Which vaccines were the worst to take? 

Who is the worse off or is it luck? 

Took 2 Pfizer and I want to clear this shit OUT. 



Do you think some countries were worse off than others? Does temperature control have anything to do with this (as in - is there potential luck for someone if the temperature of vaccine wasn’t right when inject) 

Anyone give me a sliver of hope

Also if you’re gonna comment and say that the vaccine was safe and effective don’t waste my time I don’t give a shit about ur opinion to be honest so it is a waste of your time commenting . Thank u <3 and I wish all reading the best of health.

"First and foremost, i want to state that i am NOT an anti vaxxer and this post is not to dissauade others from getting vaccinated. I've always been up to date with all my vaccines and have scheduled my covid ones the moment i was qualified in my state. However i unfortunately experienced some adverse symptoms that may or may not be due to the vaccine and jusr wanted to share my experience and magbe get some advice or maybe sew if anyone else has experienced this?

age range: 18-25

sex: female

vaccine brand: Pfizer

previous adverse reactions to vaccines:

none. i was eager to get it for the sake of returning back to “normal life” or so i could go to more places and possibly travel/have fun with friends during the summer

health: good. No prior or pre-exisiting health issues

First dose: 4/18

side effects: soreness on left arm near injection site for about a day

second dose: 5/10

side effects:

immeidate:

soreness on left arm near injection site for about a day

about 16-21 days later: 

nausea, vomiting, numbness, muscle weakness, gait disturbance (lack of balance), double vision (diplopia), eye jerking/jumping (Nystagmus), reduced field of vision (peripheral vision was reduced), dizziness (vertigo)

To explain the later knset symptoms, I was doing well up until around the 2-3 week mark after the second dose where i began experincing nausea and vomiting. At first it was occasional (one time and no vomiting until 3-4 days later) but progressively got worse to the point i was vomiting everyday for over a week straight up to 5-6X a day and i could not keep food down and barely even water.

i also started to experience gait problems that mostly had to do with my sense of balance. The best way i coukd described it would be “walking like as if i were someone who is really drunk”. I was also beginning to experience vision problems where what im seeing is blurring and fading in and out of double vision land i could “see the vertigo” as my eyes were displaying what im seeing as spinning. I initally attributed this to my excessive vomiting and inability to keep any food and barely any water down so I decided to “tough it out/sleep it off” since i don’t like going to the doctors since I actually got told i was overreacting/its anxiety when i was a kid getting treated for a sinus infection so that never left me and ever since ive just delayed going to see the doctors unless someone forced me to/someone calls 911,

I was living away from home near my college (im a student) so i ended up going back home to my parents around the 4th week mark of since getting the 2nd covid vaccine dose. I could barely walk and was hugging the wall for support or as my roommate described “ashen/gaunt and nearly crawling on the floor” so they had to help me to the elevator and walk to the entrance so i coukd get to my parent’s car. 
My parents saw me and immediately wanted me to go to the ER but i insisted it was a weird stomach flu/me not eating enough so I can just self treat at hime with some rest and soup/easy to digest foods. My vomiting was still bad and i cant walk without someone holding me so my parents to me to the ER 2X. First time i was discharged after the doctor suspected of dehydration and malnutrition so I got saline dextrose and other minerals/electrolytes and was able to eat and keep down some soft food and liquids. 2nd time i went was because i was vomiting again back at home. This time I was admitted abd it was the first time i realized i coukd not lift my leg up when a doctor in the ER did a neuro-assessment on me and i felt noticeable numbess on my entire left thigh and on half of my right thigh and lower abdomen. However i did not see the neurologist since doctors still though malnutrition/dehydration maybe it was something in my abdomen, and my vision was splitt8ng and scattering more and more that it went full double (meaning i could not force my eye muscles to focus on an image and make it one image) snd a lot of nystagmus (my eyes couldn’t keep “still” and kept making jerky movements) And during that time at the hospital, in about 2.5 weeks i had increasing muscle weakness and spreading numbess on my left side that also began to affect my “good” right side. I never had anything like this before. It felt like it all happened so fast??? Although i guess this couodve started earlier but was progressing slowly before shit hit the fan 

I ended up being in the hospital for nearly a month. Going through multiple tests coming back negative of not significant enough results except for showing high rates of inflammation in my blood test results. I got steroids and IV IG for suspected GBS miller fisher type but not all the doctors are confident. Some doctors thought it was functional neurological disorder, but others disagreed but put it on any way so my insurance will accept the diagonosis as acceptable for going to inpaitient rehab since stating my symptoms by itself woukd not be enough for coverage.

It’s been about 2 weeks since i recieved medical treatment (meaning the IV Ig since that was last) and i am starting to see slow improvements. Most significant was the vomiting, i just have nausea now but no longer puke uncontrollably (thank goodness), my walking gait stance with support is not as wide, although when trying to walk on my own was a brace to support my side, i have to still yse a wide gait and keep my arms out for balance. My vision, which bothers me the most since i still see things “spinning” and have double vision, both which are made worse with lifiting my head/looking up or to the sides or at far away moving objects) i finally have a point and angle where my double vision is resolved which is by looking at something from a very cloe distance at a lower angle (im using my ipad to type this and my nose is almost touch the screen to give an idea of how close im talking about)

ive been seeing that it looks like the pfizer vaccine is causing a disproportionate amount of neurological  side effects but as I’d imagine, most of it is written off/said not realted to the vaccine to probably not cause more hesitation in getting vaccinated eventhough its known with vaccines GBS (although incredibly rare) is a potential serious side effect, most well known in flu vaccines since my mom had GBS and her neurologist said it triggered by the flu vaccine and told her avoid flu shots since then.

i’m just confused and while I dont care much of a diagnosis anymore as i want to get back to my previous physical abilities ASAP, i dont feel comfortable and concernes with the possible explanation of functional neurological disorder espcially due to its history of being linked to hysteria and women (especially young women). The biggest concern being, since FND supposedly doesnt not cause physical damage to the nervoys system or muscles structurally, im  not sure if i should be concerned, should i end up getting one of these symptoms back in a sort of ""relapse"" and if i should go see a doctor or just wait and sit it out becuase  once again, im the type to try to “tough it out snd sleep it out” until the last minute because i dont want to be seen as “hysterical”.

just wanted to share my story here since honestly, if this side effect/my symptoms sre due to the MRNA type vaccines, then id rather get sick with Co-Vid or the flu (since i heard MRNA type vaccines are getting made for that too) than to experience this kind of debilitating experience again that im still trying to recover from and recovery is slow and i dont knlw how long it will take.

thanks to anyone who has the time to read this! And ill also be reporting this to the CDC in tuwir VAERS as well.

Oh and also  i read recent news the Pfizer vaccine might need a 3rd dose and honestly, i do not want to take the risk to tske it if the second dose is whafmt caused me to get so sick to the point of hospitalization with an indeterminate amount of rehab and no promise of getting back to my previous functioning 100%. The cost just isnt worth it for me, even for herd immunity since i just cant go through that all over again esp if im still physically weak/experiencing symptoms.",2021-07-09 13:04

"I was given Hepatitis A vaccine nearly two weeks ago bc my labs showed that I wasn’t immune to it. When the nurse administered the shot it was so painful, I nearly passed out. I’m usually unaffected by shots as I have had IVs and whatnot more than most. Fast forward to now and my upper arm hurts so badly where the shot was given. I can hardly lift my arm up or extend it. It’s very painful while sleeping, u have to use my left hand to adjust my right arm while laying down. What’s strange is that it stopped hurting for at least a week but then just started back up and got much more intense. I messaged my doctor this morning and I’m waiting for his reply.

"Please don't apologize for the long post, I love information and I am grateful for your reply. My partner and I are both diligently masking indoors with N95's, PlusLife testing with friends and family before meeting indoors, HEPA units in the house, measuring CO2 etc when working in the office so that part we got quite good at. I don't have any underlying illnesses as far as I'm aware, with the exception of a seemingly chronic hypokalemia with 'no cause found yet'.   As far as boosters go, I think I can choose between Pfizer, Novavax and Moderna. Pfizer did not cause my tinnitus but did give me a very swollen and painful armpit lymph node that lasted a month. Was told that reaction was a 'bad side effect' that was 'quite rare' and to consider switching boosters in the future, hence my interest in Novavax. Although, while typing this message to you, I wonder if Pfizer would still be a safer bet for me than a vaccine I haven't tried before given that Pfizer didn't give me tinnitus. I am wondering if getting a Pfizer booster in my thigh would negate the swollen armpit lymphnode. Do you know if it is to be expected that my reaction to Pfizer would be equal or worse than last time? Or is there no correlation? I'm sorry, this is starting to become a rambling post.

The first week of February I fell ill with these these symptoms that proceeded as following, started with loose stools the next day it progressed to fever and body aches which lasted roughly 3 days, towards the end of day 3 I developed a dry cough which 2 days later progressed to a moderate case of pneumonia, I was over everything within 10 days.

"There was a time where all of reddit constantly claimed that wearing a mask was somehow worse. Even my personal friends claimed it was worse to wear a mask than to not wear one, and they gave me some sort of convoluted explanation about how it can give a false sense of safety and that the masks don't really stop particles because they are too small. Medical experts were claiming that wearing a mask meant that people would spend more time touching their faces and adjusting the mask, thus spreading more diseases. Literally every established voice of authority and know-it-all recommended against wearing a mask. When I and my friends were discussing mask-wearing, I looked it up and found several sources making these claims as well, so I had to admit defeat. To me none of it made sense from the beginning. Now wearing a mask has close to mandatory, because it fucking works and makes sense.   It's a trend I have noticed, people latch on to the convoluted and absurd claims because they are complicated and absurd. The non-common sense approach is always the right answer because its the smart and complicated answer.

"OP, if you genuinely want to learn from others, stop using pejorative terms when asking questions--i.e., calling people who are skeptical or hesitant about the COVID jabs ""anti-vaxxers"". The term is intended as an insult, as if the person were stupid, deliberately ignorant, and/or profiting in some way from not taking the jabs or speaking against them. It would be like someone calling you a vaxtremist and a grifter for your pro-vax stance, implying that you were making money from pushing the jabs in spite of knowing there are problems with them.  I follow a substack by a doctor from the midwest US who has written several long, detailed articles on the idea of the mRNA vaccine shedding. Like you, they and their colleagues believed that theoretically, it shouldn't be possible for these jabs to shed. But they were seeing too much evidence of shedding to ignore it.   The possible mechanisms they came up with included vaccinated people being asymptomatically infected with COVID and transmitting the actual virus; shedding of bacteria that had been transfected with mRNA; and something called exosome mediated shedding.  >While not perfect, exosome shedding is the hypothesis that best fits the existing data on shedding. Briefly, this hypothesis argues that the vaccine is concentrating in the lungs (due its previously described affinity for the pulmonary arteries when the vaccine is incorrectly manufactured), which results in some (but not all vaccinated) individuals exhaling a significant amount of spike protein containing exosomes which then affect those in their surrounding. This mode of “shedding transmission” essentially allows for a relatively small difference in total spike protein concentration between the shedder and the individual affected by the shedder.  Does that help a bit? I'm far from my student days, and didn't study biology, so this would probably make more sense to you.",2024-09-27 23:36
Two points you need to factor:  1) Vaccinated can only spread in breakthrough cases.  A vaccinated person is FAR less likely to be contagious than an unvaccinated person as they are FAR less likely to be infected even as the Delta variant rages on.  2) A vaccinated person with a breakthrough case carries a less viral load for a shorter period of time than an unvaccinated person.  This means they are less transmissible.  Getting the vaccine reduces your risk of contracting and spreading Covid. This isn’t just an excuse to hate unvaccinated. This is the reality of the situation.,2021-09-22 8:57

"Hello everyone, 

I received 3 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the third one being a whole year ago. With the upcoming surge we will be seeing as we move into fall and winter, I am eager to bolster my protection in addition to the other mitigation measures I take (I am a teacher that works around almost entirely unmasked students/colleagues and I have underlying health problems/am immunocompromised). However, I am reluctant to get another mRNA vaccine for a number of reasons, primarily because we clearly can't keep up with the evolution of the virus and Novavax is more universal. 

My question is: Has anyone who is fully vaccinated with mRNA vaccines had any luck finding a loophole to convince a provider to administer Novavax given that it's not currently approved as a booster? If it's not yet approved as a standalone booster to compliment mRNA vaccines, could we simply get both Novavax shots as a complete primary series? Do pharmacists check the vaccine database to see if you're already vaccinated? I am in Maryland and the government website says people can self-attest to eligibility and that ""COVID-19 vaccine providers cannot turn away any individual who self-attests to eligibility for an additional dose or booster dose. Failure of an individual to 'show proof' of eligibility may not be a reason that a provider does not administer an additional or booster dose."" I suppose I could always go to the pharmacy and see what happens, but was curious if anyone had had any luck.

"As best I understand, the vaccines don't do much to prevent infection, and don't do what little they do for very long.   The jab released this fall was based on an XBB variant that was prevalent around June 2023, but that was already mostly gone by September. The jabs are no longer called boosters; pharma's intent now is that they be given annually like the flu shot.  Some degree of immune suppression occurs for about two weeks after each of these jabs, while antibody production ramps up. Antibodies then rise to levels greater than what's normally seen with a natural infection, with a peak that seems to be higher with each subsequent jab. So there may be some immunity for a few weeks to a month, before antibody levels fall over the following month or two.  There's also something called ""class switching"" going on with the antibodies, starting with the third jab/first booster. The immune system makes more of the live-and-let-live antibodies (IgG4), and less of the killer IgG1 and IgG3 (I think) antibodies. The class switch makes it harder for the immune system to clear the virus when there's an infection.  I follow the covid19positive subreddit. There seem to be an awful lot of people over there who have had all the jabs, who say they've been infected 4 or 5 times in the past couple of years.

I have gotten the covid vaccine and had swollen lymph nodes for a couple days following the vaccine, but nothing outside of being sick. Every person handles viruses or irritants differently. Your swollen lymph nodes could be a reaction to the vaccine, but the vaccine leaves the body and isn’t as effective after 6-12 months, so it’s highly unlikely that the vaccine is still causing issues unless you got annual boosters over the last 4 years. Swollen lymph nodes are pretty common for certain viruses so that’s just likely the culprit.",2025-01-28 7:20

There is evidence that non MRNA vaccines have harmed people in the past and I'm not convinced that they actually provide immunity for anything or are even beneficial.

The word virus just means toxin and while many types of toxins undoubtedly exist, I'm not sure that it is true that the immune system can be trained with vaccines to be more effective against particular toxins. The immune system is mostly in the gut and (as I currently understand it) its function is highly dependent on the state of the microbiome. This is unlikely to be positively affected by vaccines, but more likely to depend on diet, vitamin status, lifestyle, etc. But you see a lot of people who have had gut issues after taking the Covid vaccines, indicating that it has messed up their microbiome and their immune system along with it.",2024-11-02 1:22

But it is also a gift you give to everyone around you, including transplant recipients who have to take immunosuppressants, ppl undergoing cancer treatment, ppl with compromised immune systems, and (especially) babies too young to have had their first vaccines.   Self-care tips: it's not unusual for the site to be sore for a couple days.  Not a big deal, nothing that can't be managed with some Tylenol or ibuprofen, and it's temporary.  But I find it helpful to have the shots in my non-dominant arm, so I don't go ""erf!"" every time I reach for something.  A cold pack that lives in the freezer can help manage discomfort, too.

"M31 - UK.

I've had extreme dry mouth and thirst for nearly 8 months now. I also developed testicular inflammation after my 2nd COVID vaccine dose in June 2021.

The dry mouth and thirst issue is worst in the mornings and drinking water doesn't help it at all. Even though it started 8 months ago, I have no doubt the vaccine has something to do, as my health has gone downhill since my 2nd dose (see symptom section below).

The problem is I've already tested HBA1C (I am not pre/diabetic) and SS-A/SS-B antibodies for Sjogren are negative (I don't have dry eyes either). I've already been to a rheumatologist due to extremely high ANA markers (something autoimmune going on), but at the time I had no symptoms, so was sent away with no answers.

Other symptoms and discoveries:

\- Liver pain, been to a gastroenterologist as also had positive smooth muscle antibodies for autoimmune hepatitis). Only my ALT has been elevated, but seems to be dropping down with lifestyle changes; Both him and the rheum advised it's not AIH. An ultrasound only showed fatty liver and no pancreas, kidney or biliary duct obstructions.

\- Foamy urine (around the same time as the dry mouth). Normal kidney function tests, though.

\- GI issues (stomach burping, occasional diarrhoea, loose stools).

\- Reactivated EBV (found out I have it 2 months ago, although likely had it going on for 3.5 years since my testicular inflammation started after my 2nd dose). Have started L-lysine, Vitamins D+K2 (i have extreme Vit. D deficiency) & Zinc. Had the dry mouth even before starting the Vit. D supplements.

\- Yellow, hairy coated tongue. Likely a result of the reactivated EBV and dry mouth, causing bacteria build up. Tongue scraper usually helps with this, but this has remained for 8 months now as well. It seems to be a classic representation of an EBV symptom, despite not having any of the other classic symptoms, such as fatigue, joint pain or swollen nodes.

I don't have hypoxia symptoms (despite the dry mouth being the worst in the mornings) and my mouth seems to be making enough saliva, it just doesn't seem to be moisturising my mouth.

Any ideas? Could this be the reactivated EBV or it's something else going on? I am getting really desperate.

Many thanks.",2024-12-27 18:28

"This will probably get buried but here goes.  First of all, thank you. I've only had one customer actually talk to me about this and thank me, out of the hundreds that come through every day.  I live in Australia and work at a large supermarket chain. There is almost no preventative measures in place and the small ones that are, aren't even being enforced.   We have signs around about social distancing, and we have been given an abundance of sanitiser but how can you stop the spread when everyone is going crazy with buying at the moment. Our store is way busier than normal with customers.   All our staff are overworked and super stressed. From checkout operators to stock fillers.   You can't keep any distance from customers when they're packed in the store and constantly asking for help and for items. Especially on checkout where you have hundreds of people going through.  It seems absurd that we are still working, and I understand that if people can't access their items it would shatter the economy. At the same time our company is making a boat load of money from this. Surely there should be way more preventative measures in place but people just aren't taking this seriously enough.  For example, my store manager held a meeting with the stock fillers a few days ago, and while he was standing there talking he coughed. Then talked. Then coughed again. Not covering his mouth or anything just a cough straight forwards. Then said ""Don't worry I don't have Corona disease.""  Crazy. Australia is going to end up getting hit hard with Covid-19 soon. I just don't understand why we aren't doing more to prevent it.   We could minimise customers in store, be able to wear masks, only take card instead of cash and card, only use self serve checkouts, roster stock fillers when the store is actually closed. Etc. There are plenty of things we can do. It's disappointing, worrying and very scary.",2020-03-20 8:45

"Social media is a symptom more than the problem—the problem being the human propensity to mindlessly repeat and pass on rumors—but it’s proof that having the reach it has is its own issue.  A big part of the problem is also the flattening of authority, where in many people’s minds, the rumors they see on FB or Twitter are equal to official statements from health agencies, mainstream media, and government officials. Unfortunately the “official” and mainstream sources have often shown themselves to be untrustworthy in their own ways (the initial mask advice being the biggest). Rather than critically but fairly thinking about each claim, it becomes so tempting to then think that they are all lying, especially if what they’re saying goes against your cherished beliefs in some way. And when you only follow people like you that echo chamber just reinforces that belief. Combine it with old-fashioned American individualism and distrust of authority and this is what you get.  I honestly don’t know how to combat this without either trampling on basic free speech or letting hateful ideas free reign. Something in me revolts at the idea of FB and Twitter having to filter speech, even though they’re not the government and some of the ideas being spread are genuinely dangerous. It may not violate the letter of then First Amendment but it seems to violate its spirit. We were taught as Americans that the response to bad ideas is good ideas, not suppression...something I wish were true most if not all of the time.   But that isn’t possible without an educated populace capable of critical thinking. It’s obvious that this is less and less true of American society. In that case, maybe in a way we don’t deserve the amount of freedom we have right now. Maybe we really do have to be treated as less than mature and have bad ideas shielded from us for our own protection? But now that all those ideas and its megaphones are out, how do you put the genie back in the bottle? Just like with guns, they’re everywhere. Can you confiscate them without causing more turmoil and violence?  I have a theory that free individualist societies do better in peacetime but collectivist ones do better in acute crises. It’s more about the culture than governments; plenty of democracies like South Korea and various European nations have successfully contained the virus, and authoritarian ones like Iran have not. It all seems to boil down to whether society as a whole can put selfishness and individualism aside for a time to solve a problem for the general good. American society as a whole, led by a dithering federal government, seems unable to muster thus anymore. This is a sure sign of decline.",2020-07-04 16:46

"""Immune imprinting is a phenomenon in which prior antigenic experiences influence responses to subsequent infection or vaccination^(1,2). The effects of immune imprinting on serum antibody responses after boosting with variant-matched SARS-CoV-2 vaccines remain uncertain. Here, we characterized the serum antibody responses after mRNA vaccine boosting of mice and human clinical trial participants. In mice, a single dose of a preclinical version of mRNA-1273 vaccine encoding Wuhan-1 spike minimally imprinted serum responses elicited by Omicron boosters, enabling generation of type-specific antibodies. However, imprinting was observed in mice receiving an Omicron booster after two priming doses of mRNA-1273, an effect that was mitigated by a second booster dose of Omicron vaccine. In both SARS-CoV-2 infected or uninfected humans who received two Omicron-matched boosters after two or more doses of the prototype mRNA-1273 vaccine, spike-binding and neutralizing serum antibodies cross-reacted with Omicron variants as well as more distantly related sarbecoviruses. Because serum neutralizing responses against Omicron strains and other sarbecoviruses were abrogated after pre-clearing with Wuhan-1 spike protein, antibodies induced by XBB.1.5 boosting in humans focus on conserved epitopes targeted by the antecedent mRNA-1273 primary series. Thus, the antibody response to Omicron-based boosters in humans is imprinted by immunizations with historical mRNA-1273 vaccines, but this outcome may be beneficial as it drives expansion of cross-neutralizing antibodies that inhibit infection of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and distantly related sarbecoviruses.""",2024-05-19 14:49

">An unnecessary prolonged gathering, not socially distanced, and not wearing masks.  I haven't since February.  People like this [removed for civility] are why its been since February.  No, they're not. I feel like a lot of people on Reddit don't really understand how this virus spreads. Ideal conditions for spreading the virus are indoors, with poor ventilation, for more than 15 minutes of direct contact. It can certainly spread without that, but those are the primary conditions under which it spreads.  I'll use myself as an example. I see my family once a week, usually outside and not getting close to each other. I also work from home and dont have any other obligations during the week. The chances of myself catching it from my six family members who I hang out with once a week, outside, for 1-2 hours is seriously negligible and saying anything else is ignoring the scientific data about how this spreads. It's spreading from schools, churches, parties, bars, etc.   It's certainly possible right now to have some bare bones semblance of a social life, IE only going to restaurants seating outside, only seeing family but distancing the rest of the time, etc. Not leaving your house for 9 months has a lot of serious mental health consequences that a lot of redditors ignore because they dont like people anyway so it's easy for them. You can minimize the risk of interacting with others to a near negligible amount while still participating in things. The data from the BLM protests show this. Less than 2% of protestors tested positive because it was outside, most people were in masks, etc. You can also see data from many cities that did phased openings and didnt see spikes after restaurants with outside seating, mask requirements, etc started back up.   The guy hosting a family gathering of 6 is in no way to blame for the way this is spreading and placing blame on him while our president is hosting rallies, bars are open at full capacity, etc is just fear mongering. It's like blaming individuals for global warming while ignoring massive corporations who make up 95% of pollution.",2020-10-14 16:25

"Hello! I wanted to see if any of you have gotten a booster shot yet? I am nervous about it but know I need to get it done. Just trying to gague how it might go for me.  Background (a bit long): Covid positive 8 months before my first dose.   Dose 1 - Heart rate increased rapidly right after receiving it, followed by neck muscles tightening up so much that it felt like someone was choking me - but I could breathe just fine. 7 days later, experienced sudden numbness on left side that gradually moved to right side to a lesser extent. Went to hospital where they ruled out a stroke and bascially just told me it was anxiety.  Doctor recommended I take Vitamin D and magnesium, and referred me to a legit chiropractor. I only met for a consultation before dose 2.  Dose 2 - Exact same symptoms as dose 1, with onset of numbness at 15min after instead of 7 days. Also very tired, so i went home and slept.  Numbness and tingling went away within a month after both doses. Gentle Chiro (not some dude who just wants to manually force all your joints around) has definitely helped some. BUT, and this is why I’m writing really, my heartrate was fast for 6 months after 2nd dose. It only started to calm down after a 2nd covid infection (omicron).   I have had ekgs and lots of bloodwork done, so I don’t think it’s anything serious. But these side-effects are unsettling and really kick up my anxiety. Anyone in the same boat? I will likely get a booster regardless becsuse covid is so miserable, but I just to see if the booster was better for anyone.",2022-02-06 7:53

"Oh yes, it is for real. I'm a nurse, I do mental health case management so I haven't directly worked with COVID patients, but I've had to do some training should I be called to work in a COVID unit when/if critical care and ICU nurses get sick. That's another thing anti-maskers don't seem to care about.... If all the experienced nurses get sick, they're going to be cared for by nurses with not much experience on the medical floors. I mean, I'm smart and I'll figure it out but there are small details about patient conditions that experienced critical care and ICU nurses would pick up on faster than someone with my experience would necessarily pick up on very quickly. The other thing is code blues where a patient is basically in respiratory or cardiac arrest. If the patient has COVID, the team is going to gown up and mask up before going into the room and that can take a few minutes. They're not going to expose themselves to COVID. And also! Having more beds occupied by COVID patients means that if someone were to get into a bad car accident, they might not have an ICU bed to recover in. Or if someone needed surgery that has a lot of risks, that surgery might be delayed for awhile. So this basically affects everyone. Even people who are compliant. But do anti-maskers on facebook take any of that seriously? No. They just say everyone dies someday.

"Correct. In my state, we order vaccines through the state funded Vaccine Program which provides us with vaccines (and ironically we are not allowed to bill for them, which kind of squash's the other commenters theory).  The state vaccine program has not stocked, or made available the updated COVID vaccines for offices to order. So we are stuck with no ability to get vaccines through the normal channels, while she is telling people to call their pediatrician for vaccines there is no inventory of.  Pharmacies are able to order direct through the manufacturer, which pediatricians could theoretically establish a relationship with, however there are a ton of downsides to this compared to a giant corporation like CVS. Insurances tend to give us issues with covering even the administration fees from the COVID vaccine last year, which we are happy to write off, and since the vaccines are provided to us free from the state this isn't an issue. If we are forced to buy from the manufacturer, at $200 per vaccine, we are going to have a gigantic loss with a potential downside of upwards of $200,000 if we have the same issues as last year. This is something a giant corporation like CVS has enough pull with insurers to fight, a small clinic does not. That is a big enough loss to put your average PCP office into financial issues. I should be clear, we do not make money on vaccines, in that scenario, we would be reimbursed by the insurance company for the cost of the vaccines, we do not upcharge and make a profit on the vaccine.  To make matters worse, pharmacies are only able to vaccinate down to 3 years of age, some pharmacists putting different limits depending on their comfort? level with vaccinating kids.

These kids had no sense of social distancing, and I’m already nervous because my 6 yr old has a congenital heart defect and I’m so terrified he’ll get it, so I had to call him in and make the kids go home. They didn’t want to go home and one of the kids actually tried to lie to me and tell me he’d had a COVID19 test “just this morning.” When I tried to gently call that out for the fib that I knew it was, he amended it to “a few days ago.” As nicely as possible, I cut off the conversation, sent them home and brought my kid inside.   All of this made me feel like a paranoid dickhead, and I had a full-on cry at how dumb and weird I felt, having to reinforce our social distancing and quarantine since so many other people aren’t doing it around where I live.

"I am an 18 year old female and I recieved my first Meningitis B vaccine about 4 months ago. I’ve had on and off extremely dull/achey back pain in my lower middle back ever since then. My main concern is just that its the exact same back pain as when I first got short term symptoms. I’m curious if anyone has experienced this or has any thoughts on what might be going on ?

I’ve never posted on reddit before but I’ve done a lot of googling and can’t find ANYTHING online about long term effects from this vaccine besides “GBS.” 

My immediate short term symptoms were debilitating and I had the worst back pain I’ve ever experienced (this along with nausea, fatigue, restlessness, weight loss, dizzy). I felt like I was going to die for three days but I’ve heard that’s normal.. The only symptom that seems to have stayed is this back pain. 

It’s kind of hard to explain but its this really painful achey feeling and my back feels super compressed ?? It gets pretty bad after standing still for more than 5 minutes and I find myself exhausted every time this happens (like drained of all energy).

I honestly have no idea if this has to do with the vaccine and to be honest I’ve had hip & joint problems before I recieved it so maybe it has to do with that??

"So if your PTSD is endangering others, you absolutely need treatment. but if said PTSD is causing you injure others, you’re still in the wrong, even if we understand the cause.  Example, if you get PTSD with fireworks and go to a fireworks show. Then proceed to punch the guy next to you at the show, you’re still guilty of assault. And it really begs the question of why you went to that fireworks show in the first place given your condition. I’m not saying I’m not sympathetic but the world isn’t responsible for your conditions. You are responsible for finding an appropriate way to navigate it. If it’s a loud noise triggered PTSD, maybe avoid places with fireworks. Maybe invest in some good noise canceling headphones or a white noise machine for home. Likewise if you have some psychologic issue preventing mask wearing maybe look into alternative coving products (like those beekeeper helmets or a face shield) or maybe just consider ordering delivery or having a friend or family member get your items.

"My dermatologist, who is a very traditional, highly intelligent doc, and one of the best in my city, refers to the covid vaccines as ""injections."" The topic came up because I noticed a lot of hair loss about two weeks after getting my first Pfizer and I told her this.\*

I found it interesting that she refers to them as ""injections"" and wondered what y'all thought. I will say that she is not a covid denier or anything like that. I've actually seen her wearing a mask around the office as well.

\*I know correlation is not causation and I cannot 100% prove it was the vaccine but it is certainly an interesting coincidence at least as I have never experienced hair loss before and it does not run in my family.

"Does anyone else massively regret getting the covid jabs?

I took 2 x AstraZeneca in March and Oct 21. My gut told me not to but looking back I was a victim of the pressure and propaganda.

Plus I was booked on a 10 person holiday with family that was paid for by in-laws so if I didn’t then they would lose their money.

My dad nearly lost his life with DVT and blood clots after his booster. The nurse on the ward said she’d never seen so many blood clots. He’s on medication for life now.

I woke up too late for the jabs but declined the boosters thankfully. I’ve lost all faith in government, politicians, health care etc etc. After reading loads of stuff and seeing all the sudden deaths I’m worried about my long term health, and my family’s.

Yes I know that sounds ridiculous, because “vaccine-believing” is just science, but read the headline out loud and pretend for a second that you have a legitimate argument against getting the vaccine - this headline is frustrating for these people and it pushes them even further away.   I agree that there are people who are absolute whackos that can’t be reasoned with. But that’s a minority of the people holding off getting vaccinated. There’s still so many more Americans that can be reasoned with if we just speak to them as equals, respect their opinions on why they’re hesitating, and let them come to the conclusion, on their own terms, that getting vaccinated is safe, effective, and the best shot (no pun intended) at returning the world back to normal.",2021-08-01 15:39

"M30 (UK).

Suffering with chronic epididymitis for 2.5 years now (started shortly after taking my 2nd COVID vaccine in June 2021 (AstraZeneca - UK). Was 27 and healthy. No lifestyle changes. My right testicle swelled up 2 weeks after my 2nd dose.

Been to 4 different urologists – no help but sending me away on antibiotics.

Urine/semen culture tests - negative for STD's or UTI.

5 ultrasounds (in different countries) - none of which showing any hydrocele, varicocele, cysts or tumours. Last one didn't even show inflammation, despite my right testicle being swollen.

2 one-month courses of antibiotics - Ofloxacin (June 2022) and Bactrim + Tamsulosin (February 2023) (for prostatitis after my last urologist visit and diagnosis). Did 3 months of amitriptyline - no relief. Did 5-days of Doxycycline - no effect. 1 week of Canesten steroid cream - no help.

Tried supplements - Turmeric, Quercetin, Bromelain, Co Q10, Saw Palmetto, Nattokinase, NAC - no help. Been fasting for 2 years now as well (23:1), no change.

Done pelvic floor stretches in the case of CPPS - no relief.

Sperm count test in August 2021 - very low levels. Had a late surgery for undescended testicles (when I was 3-4). It never caused me any pain or problems all my life, though. Possible correlation between that and the vaccine ""hitting"" me down there, but no answers from urologists. Testosterone is fluctuating between low and normal levels.

Symptoms: right testicle firmness, swelling, lump at the bottom and redness and itching. It is surface level only - no dull or constant pain. Hot showers relieve it. It is mainly triggered during sexual activities. Scratching helps a lot. It mimics allergic reaction, but anti-histamines haven’t helped. A 5-day of 30mg course of prednisone is the only thing that helped significantly with the symptoms.

I caught COVID in December 2022 and left testicle also inflamed (remaining this way since then). It turned the whole thing into full red scrotum syndrome.

Positive ANA (1:320, homogeneous) in December 2022 (after having COVID). Moved to negative in November 2023, then back to even higher titter at 1:640 (fine speckled) in December 2023. Antismooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) were also positive at that time. They went negative after re-testing a few months later (June 2023), then back to strong positive in December 2023 (1:320).

ENA/dsDNA tests are all normal (anti-nRNP/Sm, anti- SS A, anti-Ro-52, anti- SS B, anti-Scl-70, anti-Jo-1). Only anti- DFS 70 is strong positive, but that doesn’t provide much help.

Negative ANCA and ASA (anti-sperm antibodies) ruled out Vasculitis or autoimmune orchitis. Negative LKM and Mitochondrial antibodies. Immunoglobulin (G, A & M) is within normal ranges.

Elevated initial CRP, back to normal now. Ferritin was high at 560 ug/L \[24.0 - 336.0\]. Went back to normal levels as well. Elevated GGT – also went back to normal. Bilirubin is normal. Iron levels are normal, TIBC too. UIBC and transferrin saturation are elevated. My ALT as well (79), although I’ve had fatty liver for 8 years now. ALT reacts positive to lifestyle changes and dropping weight. Liver ultrasound September 2023 – showed some fat around the liver.

The problem is I also developed right quadrant pain around the liver area 6 months ago, which combined with the positive ASMA (indicative of autoimmune hepatitis), has me quite worried. It's mainly triggered before and after eating. My fatty liver for 8 years never caused me any pain before until last year.

I visited a gastroenterologist and he said since my ALT is only slightly elevated and the above liver enzymes being normal + not having any AIH symptoms, it probably isn’t that.

D-Dimer test negative for blood clots. Tumour markers (AFP/HCG) negative for testicular cancer. HbA1C is within normal ranges (I am not pre-diabetic). ESR level is normal. Negative for EBV.

I am currently waiting for a rheumatologist appointment (in 2 weeks), but have no idea what tests to ask for.

Any idea on what to do?

Vaccine: If someone gets a measles vaccine, there is about a 1 in 3,000 chance that they have a seizure from high fever (scary but not too dangerous). There is a 1 in 40,000 chance that they get ITP, a bleeding disorder. There is a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of having a severe allergic reaction.

"Awesome, thanks so much for the info! I'm hoping to have the same luck this afternoon.   I'll follow up and let everybody here know how it goes.   Edit: I was able to get the 2025 - 26 Covid-19 booster (Pfizer) this evening. I live in a blue city in a red state. I'll describe my experience getting vaccinated as exactly as I can remember in detail in hopes that it'll help people here know what to expect.  First I made an appointment online with an in-network national chain pharmacy for this evening. While signing up for the appointment, a pop-up window asked if I had any conditions that might put me at higher risk during a covid-19 infection and I selected yes. I wasn't asked to elaborate on which specific conditions when making the appointment.  When I showed up for the appointment, the pharmacy tech there seemed very busy, bouncing between the vaccine check-in counter and the prescription fill counter. He asked me to check in on my phone via QR code, which I did. He asked when my last covid vaccination was (sometime in August or September of 2024, I said) and then while entering information into his computer he paused, sighed, and asked if I had any conditions that might put me at higher risk during a covid infection and I said yes. I don't know if his sigh was tiredness at being super busy, irritation at having to take the extra step of asking the high-risk question on top of everything else he had to do, or just disdain at being forced to ask that high-risk question in the first place. Probably a combination of all those things, if I had to guess. But he was friendly and helpful with me the whole time so any irritation clearly wasn't directed at me.  He didn't ask me to elaborate on what conditions I have that put me at higher risk, but I do have a BMI that puts me at slightly overweight, a history of high blood pressure, and some long-term struggles with anxiety and depression, which I believe all would qualify me under current FDA guidelines if I was pressed on my answer, but he accepted just the ""yes"" answer and didn't ask any further questions. I handed him my insurance card and asked him to confirm that the vaccine would be covered under insurance and he ran the card and said yes it would be.  After a short wait, my name was called and I went into the vaccine administration room to be greeted by the vaccine administrator. He noticed my N95 mask and asked if I was currently sick. I said no, not sick today. He then asked me if I had been sick recently within the last few days and I said no. He then asked me to tell him my date of birth (I'm assuming as an identify confirmation measure) and I told him my date of birth.  He asked me if my left shoulder was ok for the injection area and I said yes. I asked him if this was the newly updated 2025 - 26 Pfizer vaccine and he said yes. He told me that ""this version was brand new,"" and then in a monotone voice added, ""so new in fact that some insurances aren't covering it yet."" To try to lighten the mood and continue the small talk, I half-joked ""wow, well I hope MY insurance is covering it"" and he said yes it was, still in a bit of an emotionless voice. He gave me the vaccination and then told me I was good to go and just to expect a bit of soreness in that arm. I told him ""thank you, I really appreciate it"" and he said ""yep. Have a good evening."" And that was that.  I wasn't sure what to make of the pharmacy tech's sigh or the vaccine administrator's comments and monotone. I suppose if you were really trying to read into them, they might conceivably reveal some of the pharmacy workers' feelings or frustrations behind this whole political nightmare/ordeal, or perhaps not. Maybe it was just two people going about their repetitive job duties on a busy day and there's nothing cryptic or meaningful there. In any case, I was very relieved to get the booster and so far it seems like insurance is covering the cost.   Footnote: as a final note, I called my insurance company's customer service number earlier in the day to ask if the vaccine was covered by insurance, and they forwarded me to their pharmacy questions line. The insurance company's call center guy seemed to be confused on the issue, asking me what the dosage of the vaccine was, putting me on hold, then saying that the vaccine needed a prescription, then saying oh wait, no it didn't need a prescription, and then telling me there would be a co-pay for the vaccine...but I was never asked for either a prescription or a co-pay later on at the pharmacy. So I'm not sure the insurance customer call center guys have their marching orders on what the current policy is regarding covid-19 vaccines at this point...you'll probably get more accurate insurance information by just asking the pharmacist on-site if they can check your insurance coverage before you get vaccinated.",2025-09-03 20:46

People are now in a situation where they just have to feel it out, which is emotional decisionmaking, exactly what got us where we are.  Best advice i tell anyone is...  1. Calm down, this isnt the t-virus 2. If you are old or sickly, time to stay home as much as possible till we know more.  Communicate and ask for help 3. If you are fat and unhealthy,  time to start getting in shape 4. If you are the kind of person who us gross.  You dont wash your regularly,  you go into the office sick, or you stand too close to people... you should have cut that crap out years ago, now you really need to. 5. Everyone else...  you are fine.  Respect the local rules, keep being hygienic, give the hands an extra wash, and wear a mask/neckgaitor/something if you are going to be around a bunch if people, especially if they are old, fat, or gross.  If you dont, well, odds are you are still fine, but it will be disrespectful to those who are panicking right now",2020-07-04 18:01
"It emphasizes more the risk that occurs from stopping masking and social distancing once most people are vaccinated:  >As expected, we found that a fast rate of vaccination decreases the probability of emergence of a resistant strain. Counterintuitively, when a relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions happened at a time when most individuals of the population have already been vaccinated the probability of emergence of a resistant strain was greatly increased. Consequently, we show that a period of transmission reduction close to the end of the vaccination campaign can substantially reduce the probability of resistant strain establishment. Our results suggest that policymakers and individuals should consider maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions and transmission-reducing behaviours throughout the entire vaccination period.",2021-08-01 22:41
What does this have to do with covid19,2020-03-19 1:55
"I subscribe to Medscape, which provides medical information to clinicians only. They explicitly mention the importance of airborne precautions in which very small particles spread in the air. The epidemiologic data continue to point to airborne transmission being the driver of the COVID-19 outbreak. The immune response to COVID-19 is not yet understood.  The researchers found instances when viral nucleotide was present in anal swabs or blood samples even when oral swabs tested negative.  Infected patients can potentially shed this pathogen through respiratory, fecal–oral, or body fluid routes.  While the data have not yet been published, and should therefore be interpreted with caution, this non-randomised, unblinded study showed a strong reduction in viral load with hydroxychloroquine. After 6 days, the percentage of patients testing positive for COVID-19 who received hydroxychloroquine fell to 25% versus 90% for those who did not receive the treatment (a group of untreated COVID-19 patients from Nice and Avignon). In addition, comparing untreated patients, those receiving hydroxychloroquine and those given hydroxychloroquine plus the antibiotic azithromycin, the results showed there was ""a spectacular reduction in the number of positive cases"" with the combination therapy, said Prof Raoult.  There have been positive results in an in vitro study and a preliminary Chinese study in 100 patients which showed that hydroxychloroquine reduced the viral load, the symptoms lasted for less time, and they are not as severe. This could reduce the number of carriers, which I find interesting from an epidemiological perspective.  Remdesivir has been used in a few patients on a compassionate-use basis outside of a clinical trial setting. ""It's a nucleotide analogue, and like other drugs of that class, it disrupts nucleic acid production. Some data suggest that it might have some efficacy.   Others may develop sepsis or a syndrome of multisystem organ failure with renal and endothelial collapse, making it difficult to maintain blood pressure. Like with so many pathologies, it is a vicious circle in which everything gets overworked. Off-and-on treatments can sometimes break the cycle: supplementary oxygen, giving red blood cells, dialysis. We support those functions while waiting for healing to occur.",2020-03-19 0:51

"No, new cases and spread of CoV2 is not the same as death.  Vaccinated people can still catch CoV2 and spread it.  However, a negative outcome (as in death) is not likely.  Here's my personal take: - 2020 I switched to a diet recommended by doctors and the NIH (mostly plant-based and almost no meat).  I ate meat 3 meals a day for 30+ years prior.  I occasionally eat meat as a treat but it is rare. - Unvaccinated I wore a mask to prevent myself catching and spreading CoV2. - Vaccinated in March/April 2021; I have never stopped wearing a mask because I knew the possibility to catch and spread CoV2 was not 0%. - So far my conservative health stance means I don't endanger myself or my family.  I don't feel any pain wearing a mask and it doesn't bother me.  TL;DR   1. let's say you're conservative with health and get a vaccine  (with the potential for side effects; mine were minor) and wear a mask but never catch CoV2.  No harm.  Near 0% chance of death at this point in time even if you catch it. 2. Let's say you take a chance; don't get vaccinated and have a small chance of dying.

"A agree but, to be blunt, that's where leadership comes in. If you have consistent health messaging plus a rhetoric of ""we're in this together and we will succeed"", by a leader people trust, then resistance to temporary harsh measures will be drastically smaller.  The irony to me is Trump was quite well placed for this. Most people resisting covid measures are his supporters, and he has a lot of personal popularity with them. If he'd led efforts to contain covid, the left wing of politics probably wouldn't have argued with him, and there could have been widespread support for what needed to be done.  I am in Victoria Australia BTW. Our second wave nearly took off like Europe's, but we responded with a pretty harsh lockdown for months (thousands of dollars in fines for breaking it) and now we've had 13 consecutive days of zero new cases. We are generally a very liberal country but we have had authoritarian measures to deal with this, and most of the public were in favour. It's hard but possible. I don't know how well the US could contain covid now that things are so bad, but I 100% do think the US could have drastically mitigated damage if political leaders there had started early and seriously.

It’s sad that these vax-injured groups were censored and quarantined (even here on Reddit; also Google, IG, etc.) making it very difficult to crowdsource information among our vax-injured selves so that we could heal (it’s largely thanks to help on a quarantined subreddit that I did finally become a fully-functional human again; though I still have long-term side effects).

"You're missing the point. A medical professional shouldn't lie because of the ""greater"" good. Not only is it not for the greater good, it's also actively not a part of medicine. Lying erodes public trust which can damage the efficacy of the overall system - see antivax as a symptom of it (yes, you can't solve the issue entirely ever but the point is to never push that envelope). It's also unethical for a medical practitioner to lie about the efficacy of the treatment. If he thought masks weren't useful he could say something like ""current research suggests X"" but the standards of modern medicine are to be very careful and lying even if you think it's for the greater good is unethical. Patient autonomy and the veracity of the information you give them are at the top of everything - they even come before treatment of the patients themselves. You might disagree with this but this is the current paradigm of modern medicine.  Also if diverting the supply chains necessitates 0 masks be delivered to the public, so be it. They have to make a conscious effort on how to allocate masks in this current scenario.

"Abstract   We investigated mRNA vaccines encoding a membrane-anchored receptor-binding domain (RBD), each a fusion of a variant RBD, the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic tail fragments of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein.  In naive mice, RBD-TM mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants induced strong humoral responses against the target RBD. Multiplex surrogate viral neutralization (sVNT) assays revealed broad neutralizing activity against a range of variant RBDs. In the setting of a heterologous boost, against the background of exposure to ancestral whole-spike vaccines, sVNT studies suggested that BA.1 and BA.5 RBD-TM vaccines had the potential to overcome the detrimental effects of immune imprinting.   A subsequent heterologous boost study using XBB.1.5 booster vaccines was evaluated using both sVNT and authentic virus neutralization. Geometric mean XBB.1.5 neutralization values after third-dose RBD-TM or whole-spike XBB.1.5 booster vaccines were compared with those after a third dose of ancestral spike booster vaccine. Fold-improvement over ancestral vaccine was just 1.3 for the whole-spike XBB.1.5 vaccine, similar to data published using human serum samples. In contrast, the fold-improvement achieved by the RBD-TM XBB.1.5 vaccine was 16.3, indicating that the RBD-TM vaccine induced the production of antibodies that neutralize the XBB.1.5 variant despite previous exposure to ancestral spike protein.",2024-12-11 13:12

"Everyone is aware of the argument behind flattening the curve and how that relates to healthcare resources. Are you aware that:  * Flattening the curve prolongs the duration of the epidemic, and may even increase the total number of infected (at best, it stays the same). So spread is not stopped, but is in fact slowed down. The Imperial College report that first supported lockdowns made this clear.  * Deaths due to covid are not reduced by lockdown unless at risk populations are completely isolated. This should be obvious from point 1, since the same number of cases is going to result in the same fraction dead.  * Hospitals went out of business during covid, and resources that were available or became available went largely unused. It’s impossible to say if this is because the lockdown measures exceeded expectations or if the projections of how many resources were needed were wrong.  * Due to point 3, and fear of covid, many who needed healthcare treatment or preventative screenings chose to instead remain home. This is not an easily quantifiable result (although some have tried), and it is a bit more subtle than the simple book-keeping of hospital resources vs covid cases, thus I don’t suspect people in this sub really know much about it.  So even acknowledging the goal of slowing down spread was to increase available hospital resources (which, credit where due, many forget), the way states implemented it actually strained the healthcare system anyway, and probably did similar harm to what covid would do anyway (w.r.t., non-covid patients).",2020-10-14 17:37

"Heard the weirdest take from my dad last night regarding a recent local mask mandate: we shouldn't mandate people wear masks *because* we need to watch out for our more vulnerable community members. His logic was that some people for various medical reasons cannot wear masks, so a mandate will hurt them and we can't just make rules without thinking about them! The rule in question specifically gives exceptions to these people. He was fully aware of this when he dropped this take. What he turned out to be worried about? Those poor people are going to be *shamed* when they have to go out without masks!  I have several thoughts about this take, such as how many people around this area seem to think masks are some kind of personal attack and are unlikely to do any ""shaming"" anyway. And if you've got a condition that makes mask use harmful that same condition makes you at-risk enough to mean you should be minimizing your trips out and only doing so when there is absolutely no possible alternative (like if you need to see a doctor), and you NEED everyone around you when you go out to be wearing masks... but TBH my main thought is, ""oh, so NOW you're telling my autistic ass that society is 100% in the wrong for shaming disabled people for not following societal rules for reasons that are out of their control, and that those people should not be expected to make make any concessions like 'not going out if it is at all avoidable' to make themselves more acceptable?"" I mean, that's an idea I can agree with, but maybe first focus on the cases where the consequences of a whole bunch of people not following the societal rule is *not* the spread of a deadly disease. Like, I'm not hurting anyone by stimming, how about you argue society needs to stop shaming that?

"Well,  I can’t speak on her individual case, it *could* be a ruse, but it’s just as likely (actually, probably much more likely,) that she is being honest.  Obviously, leaving isolation at all is very dangerous right now, but the risk while being in an uncrowded outdoor setting is very low risk. The air and wind currents (I know that’s not the right words for it, but I’m not a professional over here!) makes the virus particles dissipate much more quickly than in a closed setting, which often has low air movements as less than great circulation.

I understand your frustration, especially if you are having to do extra to compensate her workload, but I wouldn’t immediately jump to the worst conclusion.

My great aunt actually died this morning from complications of suspected Covid-19 (she was in her 90’s and had dementia, so one of the limit tests wasn’t “wasted” when knowing would not change the outcome. She died alone in a nursing home and we cannot even hold a funeral.  This isn’t a game, ***especially*** for those of us at high risk. Give your coworker the benefit of the doubt.

So, yeah, you have the right not to wear masks....in the depths of nature, in your own home....but really, you think you should have the freedom to go to the market, and not wear it?!?!?     Just for context, cause we so often can lose sight, here's a list of other freedoms we don't usually complain about having to give up:  *   Stopping at a red light, at a crowded intersection in a major city, when there are cars coming from all directions. * Driving on the right side of the road, when there is on-coming traffic * pooping indoor, anywhere other then IN the TOILET * throwing grenades at people * stealing, murder,graft * Playing super loud music, late at night/early morning, in close proximity of residents who are likely sleeping  Just to illustrate, we generally accept that we are social creatures, we like to spent time with and around others, and we get, perhaps not always consciously, that we are compromising for the well-being and comfort of others.    Masks arent some liberal attempt at allowing riots to be more anonymous, or just a step towards making people accept orders from the government.

"I never had problems with Pfizer's vaccine/booster, but at my doctor's office they had Moderna only, so I got the Moderna Bivalent booster last Wednesday around 10 days ago, and I was suffering from headaches ever since.. Thursday being the worst. Then fri, sat, sun, mon, tues, wed were all pretty bad too, headaches most of the day, but at least each day I would get around 2-3 hours of almost no headache or a dull headache. Ever since Thursday, (8 days after the booster), the headache became constant. Meaning, no breaks, when I wake up, in the middle of the night it wakes me up, all day long. Max, yesterday I had one hour off. Today, since 4:30 a.m as it woke me up, not one break. It's level 10/10 as well. How did I manage to get worse?? Did anyone get worse? Maybe the beginning was just Side effects and now I've reached the vaccine injury phase or maybe got a blood clot or something? I can't take this constant pain.

"According to the research being done, especially in places like Israel that has a population over 60 at 80% vaccinated by February data is showing the vaccine effectiveness is fading quick and dramatically. Had you been vaccinated in January such as myself you'll find you're at best walking around with an effectiveness of nearly 20% compared to someone vaccinated in June who is around 80%.  If unvaccinated people are the only ones getting sick the concern we are seeing wouldnt be there. You would be protected with your vaccination and would have little to worry about. The truth is we will see more variants and until we have boosters available and ones that can be made quickly before the new variants take hold we will continue to see spikes regardless of previous vaccinations.  Instead we are seeing vaccinated people spreading the virus and some knowingly. I know first hand someone who is currently infected after being vaccinated in april and she continues to work at her job since the symptoms arent bad according to her and she is vaccinated. The anti vaxxers are a problem but they're a distraction from the real issue that your vaccine will only provide so much protection and it's not a ticket to do whatever you want. If the vaccine worked effectively for the current delta variant they would only be their own problem. Kind of like driving a car with a seatbelt. The direct impact is only to the individual.  I have and still continue to wear two masks including an n95 as well as limit my public interactions. It isnt hard to wear a mask, it's not hard to use common sense even if you're vaccinated. Weve had a hospital in my metropolitan area that had 20% of the admitted covid patients fully vaccinated. It all depends on when your state started doing vaccines and how long ago it had been since you got yours. And we will see a lot more of these so called ""breakthrough"" cases regardless of vaccination rates. And government officials have been warned already of this, and the CDC has discussed this internally and a lot of people are concerned about the effectiveness of the vaccines.

If you think the news would catch on a shame a company for stopping this, it just wouldn’t work.

Some are simple tubes, syringes, pumps, some are chin implanted and artificial organ pieces. All require an NDA to even see.   The mountain of money behind each one of these devices is just stupid. They’re paying multiple engineers to design the thing, chemical engineers to make sure it’s made out of the right stuff, quality engineers to make sure it is reliable, project managers to make sure all of this information lines up. They pay for multiple tests on the device, the packaging of the device, they even test the effects of the testing done on the device. When some one unwraps a nozzle for the machine at the hospital, that nozzle has a 4 inch stack of physical paper work that must be kept readily accessible for at least 8 years that says that nozzle is good and ready to use.   Lastly, government agencies work with both the supplier and the buyer, and make sure that what is bought, is used and that if UFH hospital buys 1200 nozzles, they’ve used 1200 nozzles or less.  Then they pay people to keep all the records of all of this, so when someone scans the device and 3D prints it in 45 minutes, they can take all their money.   Tldr; the US medical device system is a deep deep hole full of sticky webs to navigate through, and only people with millions of dollars can do so successfully.

Also disclaimer this happened with the 2nd dose of Moderna but the booster was worse. I tried to wait it out and took Dramamine but eventually caved and was unable to hold anything down.

I had never been sick like that before and I was getting sick so frequently I couldn’t lie down or do anything. My stomach, back, and chest were also in a lot of pain and I couldn’t stand up straight. As far as other symptoms I had pretty bad body aches, low fever, and fatigue which I expected.

The worst of it was the day after getting the booster but had lingering digestion and nausea for the following 4 days.

Not to like scare anyone but just curious if anyone also had a rough experience with nausea/vomiting.",2022-01-24 16:20

To be abundantly clear, the neurological complications include headaches, sleepiness, brain fog, or dizziness, all resolved within a day.

"> Every recommendation is ""designed to manipulate people"".  No. Not every decision is designed to manipulate. Some, even within the realm of medical treatment, just inform the person of what they believe the best course of action is, and why they believe that. There is no attempt at deception. No attempt to change people's minds if their religion or belief system, or personal desires contradict that course of action.  It's called ""informed consent"". Go read about it.  ""You don't need a mask"" (translation: you probably need it but if you get one, other people we want to have masks more than you won't get theirs) is manipulation.

"Hi all, so i have a very irresponsible cousin who has been sick with Covid at least 5, probably more like 8-9 times over the past 3 years. It's absolutely insane. These numbers might be high because only like 3 of the times he's been sick were explicitly confirmed with tests, but the symptoms are about the same each time. 

He's not ""anti vax"" but is very reclusive socially. Like im sure there's some mental health thing going on bc he goes days without leaving the house, proper socialization etc but he's been getting sick from the rare times he does go out and also his housemates (all vaccinated.) 

Im trying to convince him to get the Covid shot, but he's really hesitant because he thinks that he's been sick so many times w/o gaining immunity that the shot won't help him either. I am not a scientist and don't know what to say to this. Is he right that he doesnt stand to benefit from vaccination? Which shot should he get? ",2025-05-17 3:48
"Good for Hogan.  However, I wish he would more strongly require enforcement of his stay-at-home and masks in stores orders.  I see about 50% of people outside without masks.  Saw some people in Lowe's without masks.  Asked an employee about this.  He said that a guy came in without a mask and was the type who tended to spit when talking.  The employee went to his manager, but the manager said the employee could not say anything to the customer or he would be fired.  He said he had to wipe his face during the engagement.  The next day, he apparently had printed out Governor Hogan's order.  The  customer came back again without mask.  So the employee called the local Police.  The Police said, apparently, that they were told to not enforce the order and could do nothing and suggested calling the county Sheriff's Dept..  The Sheriff's Dept. said, apparently, that they were told to not enforce the order and could do nothing and suggested calling the State Police.   The State Police said, apparently, that they were told to not enforce the order and could do nothing and suggested calling the local Health Dept..  The local Health Dept. said they would come out ""in 5 or 6 days"".  The guy showed me the order he had printed out that he had highlighted were it says that local law enforcement and Police shall enforce the order.  Further to the story, he had sunglasses which he wore the second day.  His supervisor told him he is not allowed to wear them.  He said back 'do what you need to do but I an going to keep wearing them"".    Such is the life here.",2020-04-30 22:35

Thank you. It’s easier to work when everyone is wearing a mask and we have free access to sanitizer and wipes. We have no customers to deal with. That helps. I did tell my boss if the company decided to un-mandate masks I would stand in my work area for 12.5 hours and let them fire me. Haha. Glad it hasn’t come to that.
