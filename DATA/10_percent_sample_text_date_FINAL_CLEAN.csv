"
Four years ago, I was 33 and felt like I was on top of the world: healthy, fit, strong immune system, clear mind. I went a long time without getting the Covid vaccine. I never knowingly had Covid, and I wasn’t worried about it. But as more people around me got vaccinated (friends, coworkers, restaurants requiring it, potential travel restrictions), I finally caved. One day, I just woke up and thought, I’ve held out long enough; might as well get it over with.

I got the Pfizer two-dose vaccine. And for the past 3-4 years, I’ve been kicking myself for that decision.

What Happened After the Shot?
First dose: Nothing.
Second dose: About 12 hours later, I felt terrible high fever, chills, and exhaustion like I’d never experienced. I had to take two days off work.
A few weeks later, I went to the dentist, and they randomly checked my blood pressure. It was high, something I never expected to hear.
That sent me into a bit of a panic, so I got a full checkup: bloodwork, heart tests, treadmill stress test, X-rays. Everything came back ""normal.""
Then, I noticed my body temperature felt off, randomly chilly (especially after eating), but not like normal cold. Hard to describe.
I developed higher stress/anxiety, trouble sleeping, and just a general sense that my body wasn’t functioning like it used to.
My most recent bloodwork showed borderline pre-diabetes, another shock. The doctor wasn’t concerned and said a little exercise would be enough to keep it in check.

Could It Be Other Life Factors?
To be fair, a lot changed in my life around this time:

I hit my mid-to-late 30s and started feeling my first real signs of aging.
I’ve always run on 3-6 hours of sleep, but maybe my body isn’t bouncing back like it used to.
Fatherhood started settling in.
Stress—job, economy, stock market volatility, plus whatever stress the Covid era added indirectly.
Ongoing Symptoms Since the Vaccine
I’ve never quite felt the same since. 

Here are the symptoms I’ve been dealing with:

-Body temperature fluctuations, random chills, especially after eating or on low sleep.

-Getting sick more often, fevers every month or so that last 1-2 days, then disappear. Could be from my kid bringing things home, but it never used to happen this often.

-Brain fog & low productivity. I procrastinate way more, and my mind just doesn’t feel as sharp.

-Random high blood pressure reading at the dentist (but not consistently high at the doctor).

-Prediabetes diagnosis. Barely in range, but still unexpected.

-Odd immune-related bloodwork, elevated IgA and IgM levels, but the doctor wasn’t concerned.

-Shoulder pain at the injection site, maybe it’s in my head, but it still feels off years later.

Lower sex drive & weaker erections, not something I ever struggled with before.

The Big Question:
I can’t help but feel like this all traces back to the vaccine. I was perfectly fine before getting it. I never had Covid, so the only way it ever entered my body was through the shot. How am I still feeling ""off"" 4 years later?

Has anyone else experienced something similar? I’m open to hearing any thoughts, whether you think it’s the vaccine, life changes, or something else entirely. Tell me I’m overthinking it, tell me it’s normal aging, whatever you think. I just want to hear from people who might relate.

Silver Linings & Moving Forward:
Despite everything, I’m pushing forward. I’m working out again, playing video games, focusing on my family, and making money. I know plenty of people have it worse, and thankfully, none of my symptoms are life-threatening (at least that I know of). But they are changes to my body, and I just want to understand why.

The only thing keeping me from total regret is thinking:

Maybe actually getting Covid would have been worse.
Maybe this was all just meant to happen.
If you’ve been through something similar, please share your story. Or if you have advice on what I should look into, I’d really appreciate it.",2025-03-16 12:02
">Would you make the same argument for people who end up killing people by spreading the flu or any other disease?  This disease is roughly 10x as bad as the flu, we know much less about its impact on people's long-term health even if they survive, and there's no vaccine. But yes, I do think knowingly going out and spreading a deadly disease is wrong no matter what it is.

"Guys what is the deal. I was sicker than I can remember for a long time: congestion, runny nose, fatigue, headache, fever/chills, some cough.

Husband and I take PCR tests 5 and 3 days in (respectively), and he's positive, I'm negative. I take a couple rapid tests, all negative. I even swabbed my throat for one. But rapids aren't picking up omicron so PCR is the way. Ok maybe I didn't put the PCR test in enough so we do another PCR test on days 10 and 8, and he's barely positive, I'm still negative.

People should remember other things like thalidomide and asbest etc. we know virtually nothing about the long term effects of mRNA vaccines (or covid19 for that matter) so this should only be given to people where the risk of long term issues from the vaccine is lower than the short term risk from covid19,2020-12-03 11:33

I got my Pfizer Vaccine on 11th July, two weeks ago. I started getting dizzy and felt very tired just right afterwards, but I dismissed it since I had had some stomach issues the previous day and we were going through a heat wave. 

Next day I woke up fine, but after 30min working on my computer from home, I started feeling extreme fatigue and I ended up having to lay down the whole day.

The next few days I felt slightly better, but couldn't go out to walk, had to stay home in bed. I still shrugged it off as ""It will just stop any time soon"". 

Went one day into the office and I had the worst time. I couldn't even eat or drink without feeling fatigue on my chest.

Thursday I ended up going to the doctor because my heart palpitations and heart racing wouldn't stop for 4h. 

They sent me to the hospital and, after being there for 10h they sent me home telling me ""Everything is fine, you aren't going to die. Are you sure it's not just anxiety?"". One doctor as I was leaving admitted that vaccines were giving unexpected side effects and they didn't know what to do. They only run tests to see if I was on immediate risk of heart failure.


Monday 19th I went back to the doctor and I got an altered ECG, and they sent me back into the hospital. This time they treated me a bit better, but they quickly dismissed me and tried to blame.my hypothyroidism.

">it's also true that if 100% of people got vaccinated we could beat covid  I have no idea why you're bringing this up, as if I'm arguing against it.  I think everyone should get vaccinated, of course, but information is apparently coming on the scene now suggesting that that might not have the effect we expect it would, or that the Delta variant has at least partially escaped the current vaccines. This of course needs to be followed up urgently and probably will be.   Numbers I have heard for the Delta variant suggest that 90 or 95% of the population needs to be vaccinated to get R_0 less than one.  As far as I know, no country or jurisdiction is anywhere close to this, so it's all speculation and/or an article of faith about what might happen if we ever do.  Right now, about 12% of the world population is vaccinated, and about 1% of Africa is vaccinated.  So it's obviously going to be several or many years to achieve extremely high levels of vaccination across the world, and new variants will continue to pop up. (Vaccinating just isolated countries is not going to be helpful of course as we saw last year when a virus initially confined to inland China infected the entire world in a few months.)  And of course, coronavirus vaccines fade over time.  What's my point? I'm not sure, but it does seem as if the idea that we would immediately and completely vaccinate the entire world as a strategy for getting rid of covid is not going to play out as we hoped, and that the ongoing emergence of new variants is likely to make the situation more difficult.",2021-08-01 21:35

The reason for the skyrocket is because many people didn't know what vaers was previously, vaers was encouraged more for new vaccines vs ones with more data already, fake inputs, and the sheer amount of people vaccinated.   Vaers IS mangaged by the CDC. So if you think they are liars, why would you trust vaers?   If you have 4 billion people a glass of orange juice today and said put any bad health event you have into vaers in the next month... and only 1% of those people actually do it, you're still going to have thousands of deaths. Would you fear orange juice then? Would you blame the orange juice on their deaths just because vaers said so?  It even says right on vaers ""THESE NUMBERS DO NOT INDICATE INJURIES RELATED TO VACCINE, JUST TO LOOK FOR PATTERNS""  Or do you just ignore that part?  Aside from that, how credible is it?

(Because it had some adverse reactions with a large portion of the population and more i formation was needed…..in other words, it was not “safe” until further vetting) So, all in all, to use the argument this is all for profit, no lab would risk short term gains for a total loss of public trust is faulty.  Fact is, even your argument that they are protected from lawsuits is likely no longer true as it has now gone through the full approval from FDA.

If the blood supply keeps going the way it's going, getting a blood transfusion will be forced to transition to the organ system and people will die. That's definitely not how it has been.  Every hospital I know has already had to deny people transfusions unless their hematocrit level was below a 7, which is already pretty desperate.   This isn't directed toward coronavirus. But this WILL impact everyone who needs surgery, people who get into car crashes, laboring mothers, and people with all kinds of other diseases.   You donate blood then they have to run tests. Then they generally do other things to keep it good. Fun fact, most plasma usually given to people comes filtered out from the whole blood we donate. They also have to pay for all of their support staff to keep the company running. None of this is free.

"My Mom died in April from Covid. She was in a Nursing Home in Westchester County right near the the first outbreak in NY. She was only 66. Unfortunately she was suffering from dementia brought on by diabetes and we were unable to take care of her anymore. I feel responsible for leaving her in that place, but I know it was not my fault.  Two days ago I was out to eat with my family. I know I haven't processed her death but life really hasn't allowed me the time. The waitress had a nice colorful mask. I complimented her it and she said thank you but I hate it. She then proceed to tell me how her friend who's a nurse doesn't work on Corona anymore but instead now treats people for respiratory issues from wearing masks and this entire thing is all a hoax and that NY should open up.   I calmly corrected her about masks and say I had a family member pass and this is serious. She then asks if my mother had any underlying conditions because the virus is not a risk if you don't. Like that made it OK my mom was dead and that it was OK so many others had died. I shut the conversation down, paid the bill and left.  I pretty messed up about this 2 days latter. I can't get the image of her face out of my head, the things that she said with complete ignorance but also with complete innocence. She was just so misinformed but at the same time so certain she was informed.   I'm ranting I know, I just needed to get this out there I needed to tell someone.",2020-10-14 15:49

"A better mindset for dealing with the pandemic. A desire to be vaccinated would also likely mean better containment behaviors such as mask wearing and social distancing.

Reported the symptoms and was very skeptical about getting a booster… this past Sunday (3 days ago) I got a Moderna booster. Achy arm for a couple of days but I’ve started getting painful bumps on my toes, that feel like blisters to touch, almost pins and needles in that one particular spot. First one I noticed Monday was on my big toe which is quite big and swollen on one side like a huge bump and is slightly red and feels like a blister, then yesterday I noticed one on the bottom of one of my other toes on my other foot, and today I’ve noticed 2 more forming. They don’t itch, just painful. Is this covid toe?! Has anyone else had the same experience? I am hoping the stomach ache from the first 2 doesn’t follow suit….

In terms of the post. There’s no proof that the vaccine will get us to herd immunity. they know the percentage of people with the vaccine is high that are still passing on the virus. So really the only people that need the vaccine are the ones who need it for their safety.  We can’t blame half a nation of people based off of things we don’t even know. The truth is we don’t know if it will help for everybody to get the vaccine or not. What we can determine is that it would be very helpful if all the people who were in danger of getting extremely ill got the vaccine.   Part of the reason why so many people are following conspiracies is because the misinformation on both sides. We can’t guarantee facts about things we don’t know and then expect everyone to believe things that are important. The reason why so many people are showing up sick in Southern states is because more people are getting tested. The reason why more people are getting tested is because less people have the vaccine. This has nothing to do with whether they pass the virus on to another person or not though,2021-08-01 19:07

These two vaccines are pretty much the same both in efficacy and action. Get whichever one you’re offered first. Moderna is a slightly higher dosage than Pfizer which “can” mean slightly more side effects such as flu like or achy arm (0.5ml I believe as opposed to .3 per dose) but it’s much of a muchness.

"So people can't change to tone after we learned more about the virus?  We also had a shortage of ppe as we all know. Priority was going to first responders. People were buying masks from Mexico and china by the climax of this. We hadn't even had a European flight ban yet when this was stated, just to add context to how we were handling the virus as a whole at that point.  Come April 3rd, the CDC then recommends to wear face coverings from home made items, to help ""flatten the curve"" as it was discover coverings prevent spread of the virus. Here we are in July, two months later, and having the highest number of cases reported. I just took a cross country trip to Maine from California in mid June. Passing through NM, TX, OK, etc and people were not abiding to wearing masks and maintaining distance. We have also all seen memorial day weekend photos of bars and beaches, and how well it was handled then in certain locations.  You also failed to bring up that the social distancing measures were recommended by the CDC back in early / mid March, and keeping group sizes down. This was more important to flattening the curve because you don't need to wear a mask if your isolating or maintaining distance.",2020-07-04 20:06

Research shows the vaxxed can transmit Delta asymptomatically. This isn't JUST about the unvaccinated.   We need everyone getting vaxxed but also using masks and distancing when possible.

But let's say everybody agrees to that, they get on the flight, the flight takes off, and then somewhere around cruising altitude a customer takes their mask off and refuses to put it back on. What do you do? How is that handled? The air is recirculated, so even if you stuck that customer in a bathroom for the entire flight, the risk remains. how would that be handled? It's the reason why I would not under any circumstances fly right now regardless of what the rules are. Even willingness to enforce it can't address that particular question about that particular customer who removes the mask well into the flight.",2020-07-24 16:21

The Trump campaign also didn't inform Biden or any of his team when Trump and his staffers were infected. They found out from the news.  Chris Wallace said that all attendants for the 1st debate were supposed to show up early to get a covid test. Biden had such a test and it was of course negative.

"Hey folks, 28 Male here. I had a very low exposure risk of rabies about a week ago, more so non existent as i had thought an animal had scratched my face but now thinking back about it, was only a leaf. Due to my severe health anxiety i still went and received the RabAvert Vaccine including the RIG KamRAB day 0. The RIG was injected around my face (due to the location of the scratch) and throughout my body. I have currently taken days 0, 3, and 7 and I only have a few days left from my last dose on day 14.

 In terms of side effects, the only current side effect i have been facing since a week into this vaccine schedule is constant shortness of breath and a tight feeling in my throat. I'm constantly having to inhale through my mouth to get a full Inhale. Breathing through my nose isn't satisfactory for me. Ive also felt my throat being constantly inflamed and having mucus constantly at the back.  I've already seen the doctors and nurses, and after examining my throat and doing a swab test for anything bacterial, it came back negative and they have said there is no allergic reaction that i am facing and no swelling that they can see.

My most recent visit with my GP, he told me that these symptoms could be from the vaccine, although they will subside on their own. My most distressing and constant new symptom is the shortness of breath and the mouth breathing I'm having to do to get a full breath in. It gets also worse after eating. I'm dreading to take the last shot this upcoming weekend but i was just curious to know if anyone here who has taken the vaccine had experienced anything like me? and if they did how long did it last? I just wanna get this last dose over with and start monitoring how long these symptoms will last till i get better.

"You guys are both somewhat right but my underlying point is people on the right are making the argument that since we've increased testing by 3x from July then it is normal to see more cases.   As you point out - increasing testing and especially if it's done proactively before people expect they are sick should lower the overall positive percentage. And therefore this is used as a metric to help show that our testing capacity is at a level that should do an ok job of flagging new outbreaks and helping track/trace/quarantine (the major issue is we aren't straight up mandating quarantining and the track/trace game can't keep up with our case loads). If you are only testing people that suspect they are sick (symptoms) then that is 4-9 days lost where that person is spreading the disease, and this selected population will clearly end up producing a higher positivity rate. By all goals we should be down under 3% to even consider some reopening and ideally closer to 1%. I do know however lots of Governors are trying to point to like 5% to justify some pretty drastic reopening (in my state you still generally need to suspect exposure).   With that said, the fact positive cases are going up, coupled with increased hospitalizations and deaths is a clear indicator that this isn't some testing induced anomaly. The only thing I can conclude, then, is people making these arguments are literally fine with a thousand Americans dying daily and 0 accountability at the top. And that's what scares me.",2020-11-11 23:46

If you follow Asian pop culture you could see that it is pretty regular in Japanese movies where their characters are wearing face masks (especially high school themed movies).

"I am an 18 year old female and I recieved my first Meningitis B vaccine about 4 months ago. I’ve had on and off extremely dull/achey back pain in my lower middle back ever since then. My main concern is just that its the exact same back pain as when I first got short term symptoms. I’m curious if anyone has experienced this or has any thoughts on what might be going on ?

I’ve never posted on reddit before but I’ve done a lot of googling and can’t find ANYTHING online about long term effects from this vaccine besides “GBS.” 

My immediate short term symptoms were debilitating and I had the worst back pain I’ve ever experienced (this along with nausea, fatigue, restlessness, weight loss, dizzy). I felt like I was going to die for three days but I’ve heard that’s normal.. The only symptom that seems to have stayed is this back pain. 

It’s kind of hard to explain but its this really painful achey feeling and my back feels super compressed ?? It gets pretty bad after standing still for more than 5 minutes and I find myself exhausted every time this happens (like drained of all energy).

I honestly have no idea if this has to do with the vaccine and to be honest I’ve had hip & joint problems before I recieved it so maybe it has to do with that??

"Because in their mind, actively killing people is still a sin. And since they believe in souls that can exist independently of bodies, brain development doesn’t factor into their definition of personhood.  *Unknowingly letting people die* is where fundies tend to rack up a kill count. If people are dying because of negligence, or climate change, or if they’re killed because their killer incorrectly believes them to be guilty, that doesn’t count as the sin of murder. The outcome for the victim is the same (heaven) but unintentional death doesn’t stain the soul of the *killer* in the same way.   There’s a weird side effect of this with regards to systemic effects. If someone learns more information about the impact of their actions, then they’re more likely to be held accountable by God for those actions. So there’s a slight bias to either avoid that information, or doubt it — because if you **didn’t understand** the systemic effects, your actions that worsen them don’t count as sins.   It’s similar to the way people get really uncomfortable hearing their clothes are made in sweatshops, because they think simply *knowing that information* makes them morally worse, even if they ultimately buy the same things. Their actions haven’t changed, the sweatshop workers aren’t suffering **more** due to that transfer of information, but the knowledge taints the buyer’s soul in some way. This concept is nonsensical and leads to people actively avoiding information, but it’s basically a holdover from this Christian concept of sin as *intentional* misdeeds.",2020-06-28 4:15

For those reluctant to receive vaccination for any reason, education was always effective in my experience.  Vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccination sentiments are not the same thing.

The person has to be reasonably certain a bite, scratch, of mucus membrane exposure did not occur, and we have various means to rule out rabies in the circumstances.  Sometimes an exposure is fairly low risk, but not no-risk, so people can reasonably turn down prophy when recommended and I wouldn’t have pushed it.

"Same here. Sadly, we have become somewhat accepting of covid deaths now that its approaching half a million.  When i saw him get covid and then was immediately in the hospital i thought to myself "" welp hes dead"". didnt mean it in a bad way i just thought the way weve handled the pandemic and the rollout of the vaccine etc to me, means that we are all still in a bad way. Not many folks have got the shot, and some of those have got the second while millions havent even sniffed the first one.  Hopefully biden gets things in order, as its clearly come to light that trump not only didnt really care about the pandemic ( he and his crew rarely wore masks and after he got a vaccine or cutting edge stem cell super shot it emboldened him further to not wear or do anything about it ) there was no plan whatsoever to fix the issue.  Scary to think someone in charge of one of the biggest countries and powers in the world not only didnt have a plan, but didnt care about people straight up dying when he ultimately could have done things to prevent how bad its got.   So, vote people. Everytime theres a vote for someone in public office, get off your ass and vote. Your choice, or lack thereof, might actually come back to KILL YOU.",2021-01-24 1:12

If Trump didn’t say he was reopening the country, wouldn’t everyone still be precautious?   The virus didn’t change, it doesn’t care.   What I REALLY DON’T GET. Is how so many people who criticized Trump and ignored him (rightfully so) during the daily CV19 task force talks, who followed Fauci’s guidance on “if it seems like we’re taking this too seriously - that’s a good thing”, now suddenly don’t care or forgot that there is still a global pandemic, that the federal government supporting you through this has by and large gotten worse...  I understand some people are choosing between affording to live and risking their health, but what about everyone else?   Mom and Dad are back to work so everything is fine? But my Aunt and Uncle don’t wear a mask whenever they go out - so they’re fine. Oh they’re smart they know what they’re doing.  The virus does not care about anything, it can’t, it’s a virus.

This is not every other respiratory illness.  If you're still sitting here at this point thinking ""it's just another respiratory illness"" you're just lying to yourself.  Edit: the answer to the question of WHY people need hospitalization is because most respiratory illnesses don’t cause pneumonia and wreak havoc on other organs at the same rate as COVID.

"I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease after getting an influenza shot, less than 40 days later I lost consciousness  on my way to work. I woke up in hospital with my kids and wife at my side.  Here are a few points which can give you ideas for your book :  It is very unlucky but it can happen for many reasons including vaccine as well. For some reason which are not yet very well known your autoimmune system decides to overreact and start attacking tissues which it is not supposed to.  One of reasons why some people are dying of covid-19 is because at time of death even though the virus load is 0% the immune system went a bit crazy...  There are many things which can trigger an autoimmune disease(virus, bacteria, stress, vaccine, allergy), about 20 years ago the Hepatitis B vaccine was removed on some countries because it seemed like it would trigger an autoimmune reaction much more than what was anticipated. It took more than 10 years of thorough study to show that it was not the case for some countries like France to reintroduce it.  For your book one scenario idea could be a rna vaccine which is using transcriptase inverse using some enzyme which was not identified before to modify some gene which would produce some defect in white blood cells :-)  Note 1: I got vaccinated for covid-19, and even though my condition got triggered likely by a vaccine in the past I always consider the benefice risk and talk with my Neurologist knowing that getting a vaccine will also potentially have some negative effects.  Note 2: there has been studies on perfusion or injection(I don't remember which one) with water like content and nocebo effects were observed.",2021-07-14 7:05

But the Speculation is that because Trump has completely given up on doing anything about coronavirus and now not even having briefings or news conferences about it, Biden could start to hold news conferences about it with medical professionals leading the way. He could also begin talking with governors of individual states, companies that could be used to supply more Personal protective equipment, and even start planning with companies that will distribute the vaccine.

"Make a call thats best for you but please ONLY associate safety and vaccine together. None of this ""you're putting others around you in danger"" nonsense, that's a fallacy. No matter what you do you are unfortunately a danger to everyone else of giving them COVID. Yes your risk is reduced of spreading COVID (at least initially after the 2nd dose) but essentially the only ones that are truly risking others lives are those that go about their business in the same way pre pandemic. I see this a lot with vaccinated folk, they treat it like it's a sterilising immunity inducing vaccine.  You can still be reasonably COVID safe without the vaccine (regular testing, limiting your interactions with random people), and just because you got the Vaccine doesn't automatically make you COVID safe.",2021-12-05 4:09

"From a tech-level point of view, I doubt it.   This vaccine entails active genetic engineering to build an ""attenuated"" virus genome delivery mechanism.  AFAICT the delivery itself is within a sars-cov-2 virus, but the genome is changed to remove the structural E protein and four nonstructural ORF proteins.  Those removals are chosen based on limited testing as being non-immunogenic (for the E) and possibly immunosuppressive.  Once the virus infects the cell it will create all of the other proteins (~10 of them), and these should be presented on the cell surface similar to mRNA and vectored delivery mechanisms.  This brings an additional immunogenic step that inactivated and protein vaccines don't have (though an adjuvant can simulate), because the vaccine virus does infect cells.  It's an (extremely) attenuated vaccine, but unlike historical attenuation methods this one sounds completely reliable.  Including the genome for all ~10 proteins is a questionable choice IMO, since only the S (and really only the S1) is susceptible to antibody neutralization.  Some of the ORF proteins may be necessary for protein creation within the cell, but I'm not sure why they wouldn't do this the way vectored RNA vaccines work with just the S.   On the other hand if you think of this as a vectored vaccine using sars-cov-2 antigens as the vector, then it could look really good.  One concern with vectored and mRNA vaccines is that the immune system can start neutralizing the delivery mechanism, and for a sars-cov-2 vector that's pretty much a guarantee.  For a multivalent formulation that could actually be a good thing, since the variants in the formulation that are already well-neutralized will be less likely to make it into a cell.  Moving to an inhaled delivery is an entirely unrelated step.  We have yet to make an effective inhaled vaccine, and trying to change two things at once here will make it very hard to know which one is making the vaccine better/worse.    It's quite certain that a vaccine of this type would still need to be multivalent to achieve good sterilizing immunity against the several co-circulating variants that have already evolved.",2023-05-23 9:18

Then again with delta August 2021 , this time I experienced everything high fevers,shortness of breath, chest pain, loss of taste and smell. A week after I tested negative I rushed to the ER having extreme chest pain and left arm numbness and I started to freak out resulting in my first ever panick attack from there things started to spiral out of control. I’d feel somewhat ok for a couple of days and then feel the chest pressure. Can’t count how many times I ended up in the ER apparently I’m what they consider “Long Haulers” with long lasting effects. I had such bad ptsd at this point I decided to get the vaccine so on December 6th I got my first shot of Pfizer and literally went through hell after , I had 4 days with 0 sleep complete INSOMNIA, when I would drink melatonin to see if it helped it would only give me extreme vivid dreams and night sweats and I would wake up immediately. So I was so sick after that I decided to start getting vitamin B12 shots and saw improvement for around 3 weeks. I was hesitant on the second shot and unfortunately took to long to get it , they say you should wait around 21 days for the second one.

I had a Covid infection around early-mid August, flu symptoms and temp for one day then some weird neurological stuff but mostly mild for the next 1-2 weeks. It was my first known infection. I’m wondering if having had that infection somehow altered my immune response to the vaccine.

I normally wouldn’t have gotten vaccinated so soon after illness, but I’m fairly sure I got Stratus (no sore throat) and since Nimbus is still so prevalent, I didn’t want to wait… since apparently reinfection with another variant isn’t uncommon.

I get the feeling from being here at Reddit that most of the people who visit the Coronavirus forum are generally educated about this illness but I think there is such a huge percentage of people in our society that only know the basics and some percentage that barely know the basics.

Most of the people on my Facebook feed seem to take the approach of tuning away from news and just waiting for the government and other leaders to fix it. I don't think a lot of people actually want to hear about it and while that is completely understandable I think it puts people at risk because they aren't getting the latest information about what means we need to take to be safe. For example, a pastor might make sure each church members is six feet apart but we know that 6ft actually isn't fully sufficient now  as news in the last few days has communicated that.

"A few infos (since these questions seem to be asked frequently...) 1) Yes 95% isn‘t perfect but this test is designed to get results as fast as possible. If you‘re testing someone and they‘re positive you can still test those people in a different way to ensure that the result is accurate but at least they‘re nit spreading the virus until they get their real test result. Also you can test way more people since a test that took 2-3 days can be replaced by a pre-test that takes 2 1/2 hours. Thus reducing the load of real tests as well.  2) Bosch is a big player in many different industries. Currently their most important business partners are automobile manufacturers but they‘re building a bunch of different things as well (most notably consumer electronics) 3) This test could (and should) be used at airports to determine incoming cases before they can spread the virus (especially important after the quarantine ends (importing new cases would just restart the expansion of Covid-19 in a specific country) 4) in a few articles it was mentioned that they will be rolling out the test in Germany, then Europe and then the rest of the world.

I'm not talking hypothetical. The rate of outside transmission is incredibly rare and there's science to back it up. If this gathering were to take place outside (notice I'm talking about gatherings in general, not this guy's specifically) then the risk is minimal. There was a study in Japan of over 300 cases and through contact tracing, they found only 1 was caught outside.   Again, based on his comments, I imagine this guy was careless in other ways, probably going to bars or restaurants indoors, no masks, etc. But i'm just talking in generalities of the concept of meeting up with family and the trend in this thread of people saying they haven't been outside since February and anyone else is reckless.

Person A refuses to abide by the rules and he tests positive.  Person B abides by the rules and he tests negative.

"But also, as the study points out, this has been shown pretty inarguably for multiple other vaccines, including the flu vaccine.  ""It is therefore important to take into consideration that such non-specific effects, and their immunological basis, have been established for several other vaccines.2,21 Non-specific effects of vaccines have been observed to differ between live-attenuated vaccines and non-live vaccines; live vaccines have been associated with reduced all-cause mortality while this has not been seen for non-live vaccines.2 For example, RCTs have shown that Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis reduces neonatal mortality by more than a third,22,23 due to protection against deaths from sepsis and respiratory infections. In parallel, immunological studies have provided a mechanism by showing that BCG induces “trained immunity” leading to enhanced resistance toward a broad range of pathogens.""",2023-05-10 6:45

There's really no point in debating this with you if you refuse to recognize the institutional failings that are massively inflating the cost of education for students today, particularly for medical school students.** -  I thought we are having a discussion.

For students who aren't born rich, becoming a doctor should not come down to a binary choice of ""take on hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt or don't become a doctor.""  Not having the money on hand to pay for medical school isn't some indication of poor choices or moral failings that would warrant punishment.** -  I've never made this about moral failing.  I am presenting this issue as an adult making an important, life changing decision about a career choice.  These decisions have benefits and consequences.  The price of medical school was not hidden from your wife.  She was told very clearly how much she will owe before she even started the first day of school.  She decided to go into it.   -  You don't need to be born rich to go to medical school.  I am a newish graduate myself.  I paid off my med school on my own after I started working.  Most of my classmates paid off of theirs just fine.  We just kept our expenses low and chose a cheaper med school.  My residency colleagues who went to private ones and owed $500,000 probably didn't pay it off yet.  That's their choice.  One can take on debt that is reasonable to his/her financial situation.  State schools are much cheaper and reasonably priced than private schools.  Let's not make all medical school debt the same. -  You're making a straw man argument that somehow I'm supporting the notion that only rich people get to become doctors.  No.  All I'm saying is that if you can't afford the expensive private ones, don't go to that one.  Choose a cheaper option.  If your calling to medicine is so strong that you decide to go regardless of the cost, well, then pay the price.  **3. The federal government mandates that our young doctors spend 3-7 years in residency, forces them to take a well-below-market salary, and further punishes those among them who weren't born rich by refusing to toll the accumulation of interest on federally-held loans. If you care about fairness so much, how is that fair?**  -  Residency hours suck.  You work a lot for little pay.  If you don't like it, fight to change that.  I have nothing against that fight.  I think it's great that you wish to fight that fight.  Just don't conflate these two issues together.  You can ask for your wife to get paid more without having her debt forgiven.  Again, I'm in support of your wife receiving hazard pay.  **4.  Again, less than $400B of the $2.2 trillion stimulus actually went to the people** -  I don't support bailout of the companies either.

Like the people who starved to death in the Great Depression -> they didn't have the cash money to purchase calories, so they starved to death.  No job means no money.  No money, no food.  Some people don't have rich parents they can just hit up for extra money to buy food this month.",2020-04-12 7:11

No pain at all. 15 minute wait, I did have a very small anxiety attack that I managed to kick off really quickly ( with the help of a phone call to my therapist).

"Hi, for reference I’m a 28 year old female. Sorry for any language mistakes as English is not my mother language. I want to share my honest experience with this vaccine regarding side effects. In the beginning of March, I went in to get my first shot of the AZ vaccine. I work at a GP’s office and the AZ vaccine was the only one available at that time. So, after getting my shot I initially felt fine. I seemed to cope better than most of my coworkers the following days. Something I did notice right away, was that I got my period the day after the vaccine which was a week early. I’m always extremely regular (no matter the situation) so my period coming this early was pretty odd. It was a very heavy period, lost quite a lot of blood including big clots, and instead of the usual 5 days I was now bleeding for 8 days.. I was alarmed but I didn’t make any connection with the vaccine so I decided to wait it out. Also, a few days after the shot my stomach became more sensitive and I lost my appetite. Then, the diarrhea started. I had to go to the toilet 6 times daily and I had no desire to eat, so I dropped quite a bit of weight. After three weeks of diarrhea I decided to go to the Urgent care because everybody around me was getting worried. They checked everything, but nothing abnormal was found. Blood work was fine, there were no signs of infection or inflammation. But, the diarrhea continued for another 2 months before suddenly disappearing. I didn’t do anything different, just suddenly stopped. During the three months after the shot I also got:

- worse moodswings before and during period
- depression and anxiety
- extreme fatigue
- excessive sleeping, needing at least 10 hours instead of usual 7-8
- irregular period and heavier, more painful periods
- tingly feeling in lower legs and feet
- blood pressure fluctuations 
- unusual taste (even water was suddenly tasting like sugar)
- tinnitus and pressure in left ear only

EDIT: I forgot a few so I’m adding them in now:
- brain fog (went away completely)
- face, neck and ears turning beet red and splotchy after eating, or just randomly. Mostly occurs in the evenings. (still have this sometimes, but it’s getting less common and less severe)


Now the GOOD NEWS: all these side effects have gone away and I finally feel like myself again!! 
But, four months is a long time and this made me decide to not get the second shot. Not asking for opinions, just wanted to share what happened to me. Hopefully it will help someone.",2021-06-15 17:40

"You definitely want to get Gardasil. You're just barely older than the current age limit, but a doctor might be willing to overlook that.  You're supposed to get a Tdap shot every 10 years. If it's only been a few years since your last one, you should be fine. If you're due for one in the next couple of years, it might be not be a bad idea to go ahead and get it.  If you got two MMR shots, I wouldn't worry about getting another one. It provides lifetime immunity in most situations.  Did you get vaccinated for hepatitis A and B? If not, consider getting Twinrix, which provides immunity to both. It follows the same three-shot schedule as Gardasil, so you might be able to get both at the same time.  If you're straight, you're not at high risk for mpox, but I'd still get the vaccine if it's available. There's no telling what diseases might spread over the next few years.",2025-04-02 18:48

But continuously pushing against people who have completely politicized this pandemic seems so pointless that to preserve my own sanity, I’m just done trying.

You’re literally not though. The death rate or whatever you are quoting is not the full picture. Yes I quoted deaths because I think too many people are brushing off this incredible loss of life and just spouting death rate statistics without considering that the ease of spread means more people are infected and spreading (often without realizing they are sick due to a symptomatic or late onset of symptoms). This is making it more and more difficult to contain (which is in contrast to other memorable/recent viruses that had higher death rates but quicker and more apparent symptoms making them more likely to be identified and contained).  If more people are infected then the “low” death rate suddenly skyrockets to huge numbers. Not to mention the speed of spread means  hospital beds and resources are taxed causing other ailments to not be treated in a timely way or even at all — furthering the devastation of this virus. The lack of a unified response and many people quoting these same statistics are “literally” encouraging the spread.   Stop being such an ass. I’m not advocating for long term lockdowns here just asking you to be a bit more careful with your words because you are just feeding the stupidity.,2020-10-14 16:59

"I hope you find them as awesome as I did. From now on, I’m either wearing a soft seal n95 or full on p100 half face respirator.   Funny enough, the first time I bought the soft seal was right as the pandemic started early March, I went to Lowe’s and all the had were the soft seal v fold and I had the same reaction you did “whatever, I’ll buy this noname thing I’ve never heard of but I really wanted my cheap 3M dust masks I used to buy for construction”, but when I tried it on I was like “holy shit this thing is awesome, it seals as good as my half respirator”. If they had what I was looking for I would have never tried them and been happy with the junk I was looking for.   Then a little while later I went to their website and saw they sold a 3d shaped cup version,  it I was like “I think I like the ones I can fold up and put in my pocket better.” I tried one when I saw one pop back on the shelves in Lowe’s months later, and liked the fit even more than the vfold, it was much easier to maintain a tight seal around the nose bridge in particular.  It was the perfect mask... except for during a pandemic because of the valve. Since I still had a good use for masks with valves (forest fire smoke everywhere), I ordered a few valves masks direct since I couldn’t find the size I wanted at Lowe’s and got on their mailing list. Then they emailed me a week ago saying they released a valve free version, and the only thing that sucks is they are 2x as expensive than if I could find a 10 pack to buy, but all things considered I’m glad they exist and that I can buy them at all right now.

This happens within 1 to 3 weeks.   All of this is being done behind the scenes without a problem or symptoms but in some babies, the immune response mimics a real but highly subdued version of the disease. In our case my kid only had classic very mild rubella symptoms and didn't have any fever. It didn't affect her daily routine at all.  Rubella is generally a mild illness but can have some moderate symptoms like lethargy but with the vaccine, you get either visual symptoms like a rash, very mild fever, or both.

This causes your body to produce antibodies and then your body will now remember and recognize the pathogen in the future and knows how to produce those same antibodies in the future. You body does this whenever it encounters a virus, whether by natural infection or through the means of a vaccine.

All my blood work came back normal, and eventually I was sent home. Before I was sent home I felt the numbness and tingling diminishing. But when I stepped down oh my feet from the bed I noticed my foot in a lot of pain. And when the bottom of my foot is pressed it worsens. After about 30 minutes that disappeared.

Results just came in (midnight here) so we are treating this as both are positive but I think I will go get tested again today.

"Their union sucks so bad. They don't even get sick pay. Instead, their union leaders wait for government legislation to require sick pay from all employers.

Yet, we treat them like they don't even qualify as humans.   When they get sick and miss too many days, their employers require them to pay for a doctor's office visit to prove that they really did miss due to a health reason. Suppose they catch the flu. They miss out on their normal income, because they don't get sick pay. Plus, they have to pay for a doctor's note. Okay, for COVID-19, they MIGHT get sick pay, but for any other contagious disease, nope. Why not? The same logic applies. If we don't pay them sick pay, they will work while sick and spread the contagions.  Our corrupt government doesn't care about our workers. Their union doesn't care about them.

"EDIT#2: I JUST REALIZED THIS IS AN ALT-RIGHT SUBREDDIT


I for one cannot wait to get one of the new boosters. I don't know, there's just something about the experience. It's a vibe, like we're all in this together and are united as one through the vaccine. It's like good vs evil. We are united in masks and boosts against the evil novel sars-cov2-19 coronavirus and the far right Trump supporting antivaxxers. Another benefit is that I'm socially awkward so the mask is another form of protection, in a psychological way if that makes sense. It gives me more confidence to be myself and stand up for what's right in this world (the vaccines and masking). Anyone else looking forward to it?

Edit: Another benefit I just realized is that when posted my updated profile picture on Facebook with the covid-19 vaccine sticker (indicating my positive vaccine and boost status),  I got the most likes I've ever received on a profile picture in history! That is another example of one of the many indirect positive benefits that these new vaccines are responsible for.

"Abstract - Oct 9, 2024           The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recurrent influenza epidemics underscore the need for improved vaccine strategies, as the current vaccines face several challenges including limited mucosal protection, reduced efficacy against new variants, and waning immunity. We present an innovative bacteriophage T4 nanoparticle-based vaccine design that simultaneously targets both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. It integrates three promising approaches: intranasal delivery for mucosal immunity, incorporation of multiple conserved antigens for broader protection, and nanoparticle presentation for enhanced B cell responses. By leveraging in vivo CRISPR genome engineering and in vitro SpyCatcher-SpyTag conjugation, this 120 x 86 nm T4-CoV-Flu vaccine nanoparticle incorporates 100s of antigen molecules from both pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain trimers, influenza hemagglutinin stem domain trimers, and M2e peptides on the capsid surface, while encapsulating matrix or nucleocapsid proteins inside. Intranasal administration of two doses of adjuvant-free T4-CoV-Flu vaccine to mice induced robust immune responses including high-titer IgG, secretory IgA, and neutralizing antibodies, balanced Th1/Th2 responses, and strong effector and memory T cell responses in both systemic and mucosal compartments. Notably, the vaccine elicited lung-resident CD8+ T cells, diverse memory B cell populations, and conferred complete protection against lethal challenges with both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. Furthermore, the T4 platform's rapid adaptability allowed vaccine candidate generation in 2-3 weeks. Coupled with its scalability in bacterial systems, thermostability, and adjuvant- and needle-free delivery, T4 thus presents an extraordinary platform to design potent mucosal vaccines against pandemic threats, and to bring vaccine access to resource-limited settings across the globe.

Just as I don't give any president personal credit for every single thing the federal government does because they are the one that signs the budget, I don't see allowing this project to move ahead as him personally making any contribution or commitment to that project beyond what we'd expect any reasonable person to do in such a circumstance. I'm not trying to hold him to some standard where it would be impossible to get credit for anything and in my prior post I highlighted some areas where I believe he could have demonstrated a serious commitment through his own personal actions and words.   I respect if you do find this project shows that Trump seriously committed to combating COVID, but I don't find it convincing enough to alter my opinion on his shown commitment to stopping the virus.

As that is more what is appropriate for an illness.  Getting sick is a nuisance even if it doesn’t kill you or cause long COVID.  And productivity wise a vaccine is definitely cheaper than being out for 2 weeks.  That’s why I’ve been so confused by the policy toward covid shots.  Like isn’t it better to not have to deal with being sick?  It’s not like the shots have serious side effects compared to Covid itself….,2025-09-18 1:01

Death rates countrywide are still falling and it's a 0.26% estimated death rate.,2020-07-02 17:56
"To preface, I worked as an RN in the ICU during COVID and was begging everyone I knew to get vaccinated. I interacted with many unvaccinated patients who died from COVID, and very willingly got all three vaccinations, all from Pfizer. I am not blowing any whistles, just seeking info from all angles to figure out what’s been going on with me.

Since 10/2021, the month I received my third booster, I have had abnormal and intensely painful periods. These begin with spotting, then a few days of nothing, and then 7-8 days of full and particularly heavy flow, with a total of around 11 days of bleeding. During the first two days of full flow, I have debilitating low abdominal, low back, hip, thigh, and knee pain. I feel feverish and cannot get warm, I am very fatigued, and have intense brain fog. During this time, I cannot do anything but lay down. Ibuprofen will help with pain, but it usually takes 2-3 hours to have an effect, and then I must take it every 3.5 hours.

I took meloxicam (anti-inflammatory used typically for arthritis or other joint pain) for a short stint in 2023, during which I had normal periods with virtually no pain.

In January of 2024, I started taking supplements to boost progesterone, as most of the issues I am dealing with these days could be linked to an abundance of estrogen. I now have slightly shorter cycles, a little less pain, less fatigue and brain fog, less bleeding, and no feverishness.

A few other things that happened prior to my cycle changes could have increased my estrogen levels, and I’ve also since discovered I have a gene mutation that affects my ability to process estrogen and B vitamins. In the spring of 2021 I took estrogen based birth control for the first time. I also used plan B, an estrogen based medication, in August 2021.

It seems like a perfect storm that led me to have an imbalance of estrogen and progesterone. I don’t know if the vaccine had anything to do with this, but I am aware that it affected a large number of women’s cycles immediately after vaccination, but these changes were not recorded as being long term. I’m interested to hear from anyone who knows about the mechanism of action that led to these brief cycle changes for other women.

Of note, I have been dealing with chronic pain and inflammation since summer 2023. Also, I only had Covid once in June 2022.

Has anybody else experienced similar changes around the time of vaccination that have not gone away? I’m just trying to get to the bottom of what happened and what continues to go on in my body, and our US healthcare system is often woefully incapable of helping women with issues related to menstruation.

"It’s been 3 weeks since my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, Male 25. Very healthy, fit, with a clean bill of health with no prior medical history. 

I immediately had heart/chest issues after the first dose of the vaccine. These symptoms included tightness of chest, chest pain, shortness of breath, heart palpitations (racing heart, pounding, fluttering), muscle cramping, and bad acid reflux. They arose the day after the vaccine, and progressively got worse over the course of a week. Especially when I was laying down, or trying to sleep my heart would just pound in my chest. I went to the ER because these are the symptoms of myocarditis/pericarditis. They did blood work, chest X-rays, and an EKG. They found absolutely nothing. After no relief of the symptoms I went back again. Another EKG, and still nothing. The doctors kept beating around the bush that it had nothing to do with the vaccine (which began to piss me off). The symptoms began to die down, but then came back and didn’t go away. And I knew it was inflammation of some kind because chest pain and shortness of breath would be relieved with ibuprofen. But heart palpitations would persist.

I decided to go see my general physician because I trust him, and he’s a really good doctor. He looked over everything: EKG’s, X-rays, and blood work and confirmed nothing was showing up on the tests. However he said that he’s seen younger men that have been having these issues after the vaccine, and that it is an immune response causing the muscles and the lining of chest to become inflamed contributing to shortness of breath and heart palpitations. He said its akin to costochronditis. The acid reflux is another known symptom of the vaccine and could also be aggravated by the costochronditis. He did attribute it to the immune response from the vaccine (finally). He cautioned that I should NOT get the second dose for 3-4 months. 

He prescribed me magnesium supplements (you can buy these over the counter) to help with heart palpitations and the chest pain, and so far they have relieved all symptoms except the acid reflux. I get acid reflux now from just a sip of coffee, so hopefully that will go away soon. He did mention that you want to vigilent about what magnesium supplements you buy, because in some people they cause diarrhea. 

Anyways, this is for those of you who have had symptoms like me and doctors poo-poo it off as if its nothing and “can’t find anything wrong”. You likely have a kind of costochronditis from the immune response caused by the vaccine. If you have these symptoms and haven’t seen a doctor, go get checked.

"okay. so you were taught logic in college. great. if i talk to some biden voters, can i then make claims about the majority of biden voters based on that experience?  i’ll answer for you just to move things along: no, you can’t, obviously. that’s anecdotal evidence and you would dismiss it if it was coming from others. if i told you i knew a bunch of medical people, who worked in the medical field in a capacity relevant to all this, who refused the vaccine, would you allow me to extrapolate our larger claims based on that (assuming you believed me)? no, of course not. so, already you’re demonstrating that you’re not being logical yourself because of your own biases and presuppositions.  secondly, here’s your real error that you apparently didn’t get while bridging science, logic, and philosophy. you’re dealing with risk assessment. risk assessment is not a matter of FACT, its a personal decision. does science and data tell me i should or should not drink alcohol? no. DATA doesn’t do that. so if someone looks at the data and situation and decides they should drink alcohol, and someone else looks at the data and decides they should not drink alcohol, neither is INCORRECT. its a personal assessment of risk that cannot be reduced down to the correct or incorrect binary.  so if someone looks at the data and situation with this vaccine, and decides not to get it, that isn’t a factually inaccurate assessment like if someone says a table is 5 feet tall but it’s actually 4 feet tall. if someone says they personally feel it’s too risky to do something, that can’t be “fact checked”.  that’s why (really read this part) you are being philosophically naive when asking for evidence and determining if that evidence backs up their risk assessment. it doesnt work like that. if there’s even a .000001 percent chance of an adverse effect, someone can decide that they don’t want to do that, and that can’t be “fact checked”. then when they show you evidence, you of course look at that evidence in terms of your own subjective risk assessment, and you say “wow, this really doesn’t add up”, and pay yourself on the back for being the correct one when actually you’re just too dumb to realize that you’re operating on a lower level, you made a SUBJECTIVE call (that you should take the vaccine) and are too stupid to see that it isn’t an objective fact like a ruler being 12 inches.",2021-09-14 12:04

"I noticed that the description of this subreddit says that we're dedicated to providing factual information and news regarding vaccines. This gave me an idea. When you're arguing with someone who's nervous about vaccines, it helps to be able to provide concrete data. So here's what I'm thinking: Working together, we compile a research document *(probably a google doc that's publicly shared)* that features dozens of links to sources that confirm the safety and effectiveness of vaccines - links to studies and experiments that have been peer-reviewed and fact-checked, articles published in scholarly journals, statistics regarding how effective vaccines are, as well as counterarguments to anti-vax talking points. This way, when you're arguing with someone or trying to convince them, you can immediately cite concrete evidence. I was thinking that the document could be organized into the following sections: An introduction on what vaccines are and how they work, a section providing a list of peer reviewed, fact checked studies and experiments conducted by scientists and doctors proving the effectiveness of vaccines, a section on the statistics and numbers we see when vaccines are used for real in a population *(numbers and rates of vaccinations, number of disease cases prior to mass vaccination vs post mass-vaccination, percentage of vaccinated people who experience side effects and breakthrough infections vs percentage that don't, how the severity of breakthrough infections & side effects compares to the severity of infections in unvaccinated people, etc)* as well as a final section debunking the various arguments used by anti-vaxxers. If we all work together to provide links to this sort of evidence in the comments section under this post, I could compile them into the document, and we could maybe even make a copy of that document into a pinned post in this subreddit. We could also get some help from the members of the subreddit r/VACCINES, and maybe the research document could be available there too. What do you say, sound like something you'd be interested in?

Shot 3 (Mid december): Initially, only sore lymph nodes. However, a month after the shot, out of seemingly nowhere the tension headache and brain fog returned, with vision issues. This has lasted about a week now, and has been more consistent than before, but a bit more mild– however still frustrating and debilitating. I am having trouble focusing and this is also preventing me from Cycling (my passion), as I feel it's risky when feeling mentally clouded. 

I saw a GP and a neurologist after shot 2– both said it's too early, we know nothing except these vaccines cause a lot of inflammation. Wait it out. 

I saw an eye doctor yesterday for a yearly appointment and discussed with him. He told me it could be ""vertical heterophobia"" caused by inflammation– potentially treatable with lenses, but I should wait to see if it fades before treating (as obviously this would change both glasses and contact prescriptions, and may not be needed permanently).",2022-01-22 2:40
"My father in law has been in nursing care since 6 weeks after his second shot. Calcium levels were so high they couldn’t get them leveled out with medication. He has also been on lithium for most of his adult life and those levels also got dangerously high. Fast forward about 6 months and his calcium levels lowered and lithium leveled out. He goes and gets a booster and 6 weeks later back in the same spot. - in the last nine months he has gone from living by himself and driving, to not even being able to stand/walk/speak/feed himself- as of today.",2022-02-28 9:51

Stores are allowed to ask whether or not it’s a service dog and if so, what task does it perform?  Stores are also allowed to kick out dogs who have not been adequately groomed. Dog allergies are not severe. You can deal with a runny nose and some sniffles for a minute. Either way you won’t get an allergic reaction if you’re staying away from the dog like you should be and the dogs being groomed as it should be.

Also, the more unvaccinated people there are the better chances of of the virus mutating over and over.

We get new flu vaccines every year because it mutated rapidly in fact the guard variants protect against the 4 mutations they they think will be the most prevalent based on the data. It will give some protection against other variants but at reduced effectiveness because it was designed for that variant. Covid thank goodness doesn't mutate as often as the flu.

Friday after work I had a doctor's appointment, and decided to get my flu and covid vaccines while I was there. 

I've had 3 boosters in the past after my original one, and never really delt with much in the way of side effects. This year though I feel knocked on my ass. Saturday all day I felt exhausted, like I could have just fallen asleep, and by the evening I was feeling dizzy and flu-like. Today I woke up feeling better, but now that it's evening time I'm feeling dizzy and ill again, not as bad but it's still annoying. I'm also getting diarrhea today, but it could be from the Mexican food we had last night, as my wife's stomach is upset too.

"It emphasizes more the risk that occurs from stopping masking and social distancing once most people are vaccinated:  >As expected, we found that a fast rate of vaccination decreases the probability of emergence of a resistant strain. Counterintuitively, when a relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions happened at a time when most individuals of the population have already been vaccinated the probability of emergence of a resistant strain was greatly increased. Consequently, we show that a period of transmission reduction close to the end of the vaccination campaign can substantially reduce the probability of resistant strain establishment. Our results suggest that policymakers and individuals should consider maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions and transmission-reducing behaviours throughout the entire vaccination period.",2021-08-01 22:41

"Has anybody become more susceptible to virus symptoms (aches, cough, congestion, flu or Covid-like symptoms) following their vaccine or boosters?
In 2021 I had the Moderna 2 shot series, as well as the Moderna booster that fall. Noticed really heavy/lengthy periods after that in 2022 but chalked it up to PCOS. 

Had some minor illnesses in the year but never tested positive. Got the bivalent in fall 2022, and Covid a few weeks later, a tough run. Following, I had acute virus symptoms most weeks, including aches, headaches, cough, congestion, runny nose, and sore throat. Sometimes these rose to a level of a week plus with continuous symptoms (like a new acute infection), but it often seemed to be a few days’ “hangover” from going to the office (2x a week) or the grocery store.

I improved my mask game (KN95 -> N95 -> taped N95), added filtration at home, and stopped going out nearly as often, eventually moved to my own space from an apartment. Now I only seem to have the viral symptoms after being in public indoors with an untaped mask (eg a last minute trip to the vet), but it’s super frustrating! 

I wasn’t sick like this in 20-22, until the end of the year. Wondering if anyone else has experienced becoming more sensitive to the virus with additional exposure (either vaccine/booster or infection).",2023-12-13 5:03

"Hello all, wondering if anyone here has experienced anything similar?..  Thank you for reading.

58 yr old healthy male, non smoking, low alcohol, no health conditions, except this...  

In August 2021 I had the pfizer vaccine.  About two weeks later I developed a mild ""discomfort"" in my chest.  Usually in the left breast area, but occasionally on the right and sometimes in the center.

It started on and off, random, maybe twice a week, 1 to 2 out of 10.  I could never recreate it at will. Feels like a muscular ache, almost like a pulled muscle.

Over the last 16 months it has slowly ramped up to chronic (non-stop discomfort), varying from 1 to 5.  Nothing I do (like stretching, exercise) makes it better or worse.  Neither acetaminophen nor ibuprofen do much.  

Had xrays, chest MRI, heart stress MRI, ultrasound, blood work...  Two cardiologists and three primary care doctors.  Consensus is its not anything heart, lung or digestive tract...  Heart even shows ultra high health scores.  

Myocarditis has been ruled out.  Doctors are stumped, though they are continuing to offer other exploratory test procedures.  (Left heart catheterization, endoscopy, etc.)

Not saying the vaccine is the cause, but its the only correlation we can think of.  

Has anyone else experience anything similar, a chest pain/discomfort that persists for more than a year?

"I recently had an appointment with a rheumatologist, and I was told to slow down my level of exercise. while she hadn’t seen any vaccine injured patients before me, she told me my various symptoms over the last four years that I’ve been dealing with this injury, mimicked pretty close to what she is seeing in her long Covid patients.  My injury started in the early days of the vaccine being available in 2021, because I was a non-clinical healthcare I had access to it early.  Prior to the vaccine as an early 30 year old male, I was exercising every single day and generally had no major life concerns or issues. I could play basketball literally with no break for 5-6 hours until my body was covered in salt from sweating. I ran on 6 hours of sleep with no issues.  Four days after my second Pfizer shot, I was getting ready to exercise again and all of a sudden my heart rate shot up to about 190 bpm. I called my brother who is a ER doctor and he told me to go to the emergency room where they checked me for a heart attack and various other ailments, but was not able to determine why my heart rate was so high.  Over the course of the next 10 months, my heart rate would randomly jump up from my resting 60-65bpm to 160-180bpm 5 to 10 times a day. Alongside that I had oxygen issues, extreme fatigue, vertigo, and dizziness internal tremors for the next few years. Basically I was bed bound and stopped exercising completely for the next few years.  Ironically, in late 2022 I caught Covid for the first time and almost overnight, a lot of of my symptoms practically vanished. although I still have some lingering issues to this day, mainly fatigue now and again a random heart increase for no reason, overall I’m about 85% back to my pre-vaccine self. I’ve also stopped dreaming completely or at least I’m not remembering anything.  I have seen countless doctors and they agree I was a vaccine injured, but don’t have any idea of how to help. I’ve lost my 30s to this crap as near 39 this year.  My rheumatologist said to be in a low metabolic rate to continue to give my body rest to fight off whatever the vaccine is causing. However, then I’m dealing with other issues of lack of exercise so I’m damned either way  I’m not anti-vaccine given how early I took it, but the issue I experienced during my ordeal is that medical professionals were scared to say it was the vaccine until very recently, which sadly delayed care for a lot of people that have been injured from this .

"Maybe take that out on the people who refused to get vaccinated when THEY WORK IN MEDICAL. The people who traditionally require the most medical care are the ones who are really the incubators for the variants. Immunocompromised people. Like me. A virus passing from one vaccinated person to another vaccinated person doesn’t have a whole lot of time, and therefore chance, to mutate. It’s when it hits someone like myself. I’ve had two Moderna shots and I’ll get the booster as soon as it is available in my area again. The amount of antibodies I’ve gained from those two shots is very small. So let’s say I get smacked in the face with Delta. Much higher odds that I’m going to be seriously ill and as close to certain as can be that I’ll be significantly more ill than a normal person. So it gets to sit in me, having a nice little vacation, looking at the sights and taking its time. And mutating.   It’s as close to proven as it really can be that the Alpha and Delta variants were born in that exact way; an immunocompromised person who spent weeks to months dealing with the virus. A virus never stops evolving, but it needs TIME to do that. If you’ve gotten vaccinated, you’re denying that virus much needed time to learn and mutate. Just like how you’re not sick for an extended time in the hospital. Maybe you get a breakthrough infection, but you’re not giving the virus the chance to learn what it needs to know from you to become bigger and badder.  I can hear the cries of “well then you stay home!” But you see, that’s just ignorance and selfishness. I take Humira. And Humira is the highest selling drug in the world. The people yearling that don’t care to know that I’m not a cancer patient. I haven’t had an organ transplant. I’m a 38 woman who owns a business and you’d never know by looking at me that my immune system is almost nonexistent.   But I’m the patient you see much more frequently than others. Just normally. Without a pandemic going on.  Fact: the vaccine makes it less likely you will catch COVID. It also DOES reduce the spread and ANY reduction is STILL REDUCTION.   Those medical “professionals” who refused to get a vaccine SHOULD be fired. They are either ignorant of their own field or uncaring assholes when it comes to their most frequently seen patients, or both I guess. But don’t think for a moment that variants wouldn’t slow way the hell down if everyone would get the vaccines. It would. Because you’d stop infecting ME. And THAT would be where you’d REALLY knock COVID out. If I’m not sick for an extended time, wow. You’ve just really taken away the prime way that this virus continues to mutate at such an astronomical pace.  And bonus, you’re way less likely to end up in your own ICU, bogging down your coworkers, and way WAY less likely to be taking that last chance to live ECMO from people like me.   To have my own selfish asshole moment, I deserve that bed and that ECMO more. I got my vaccines. I felt like shit afterwards. I feel like shit after my flu vaccine every year. Same with my pneumonia vaccine. Maybe I didn’t get many or any antibodies BUT I TRIED.   If you are too stupid to understand science and how basic shit like vaccines work, I don’t want you to be giving me health advice. If you don’t give a shit about the most vulnerable of your patients you shouldn’t be in fucking healthcare.  I’m sorry you’re overworked but don’t even try to pin any of your suffering on the mandates. Sir or ma’am you take that shit to the place your crappy situation actually was born from: YOUR OWN FORMER COWORKERS. Not even feeling the need to bring up how they should lead by goddamn example when it comes to the vaccines. They get them, crackpots stop taking their refusal as the sign that bill gates is definitely trying to inject everyone with satans microchips and turn them into human fridge magnets or what the hell ever, everyone gets their shots, no overcrowded hospitals.   All your misery comes from those people. And given what they want they’d only be aiding the virus in rapid mutation that outpaces what the current vaccines can protect against thus leading to more loss of life.

On top of that nobody  knows the long term effects of this vaccine. In israel for example, 75% of people in the hospitals are vaccinated, so it's not exactly a miracle cure.

When I heard about Novavax & that it was less likely to cause side effects, I was very relieved. I'm glad that at least our elderly population will have access to it because they are very much under vaccinated & most at risk. However, I think it should be up to everyone's Dr to recommend what vaccines are best for you. And as much as the mRNA vaccines have saved lives, many people have become distrustful of them because of all the anti-vax sentiment out there. I think offering a vaccine that works differently is a great way of encouraging those who can't take mRNA vaccines or who just feel more comfortable with another type of vaccine. If it will encourage more people to get vaccinated, why would they make such a stupid standard? I hope this ends up changing. Otherwise it would be a real shame.",2025-05-19 19:59

I awoke one morning feeling like someone had kicked me in the ribs and was very short of breath.  Like a dumb ass I got up and ""walked it off"" and went on to work.  By 9AM I was in the doctors office.  By 11AM I had deteriorated to the point that I was moved to the emergency room and was once step short of being put on a ventilator.  I went south just that quick.  I was in the hospital for 3 days on oral and IV antibiotics, steroids, oxygen and breathing treatments every two hours.

"Not by the numbers people are talking.   Additionally, if you look at Oregon and Washington, both of those states actually have had relatively little impact to their death counts due to taking it seriously early on. They've also been in lockdown since mid March. If your theory had merit, those two states would have been significantly over the threshold for excess deaths. Oregon probably will be for the coming weeks, but when I looked about 2-3 weeks ago, Oregon hadn't even passed that threshold. Washington was mostly toeing just over that line.   So we basically have at least two states we can sort of use as controls, and those say that theory is wrong. I understand the logic of the theory, but I see nothing that supports it.",2020-07-04 20:34

""Be a little more careful?"" Are you fucking kidding me?  Or am I being too harsh? He thinks his words will maybe save others so he is doing press out of the goodness?  *>  With the upcoming Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, Green said to “take a little bit of extra precaution” and hold family events, if they’re necessary, outdoors or in a large space.*   **A 'little bit' of a precaution that is synonymous with your 'little bit' of a 'feeling of guilt' perhaps?**  If you are going to speak to the people to try and tell them how dangerous this virus is to their parents and grandparents, THEN FUCKING TELL THEM HOW DANGEROUS IT IS.  The superspreader event at the white house was fairly certainly traced to the rose garden event, which, while it was outside, was not spaced properly. A 'little bit' of 'extra care' and have it outside as a demonstration of tha care is akin to suggesting telling people to use a little bit of extra caution as a bomb tech and wear a cloth mask and nitrile gloves.  **tl;dr** it's not 'take a **little bit** of *extra care*' when holding family events (unless you hate your family and want them all dead to begin with) **it's FUHGETTABOUTIT until a later date.**",2020-10-14 20:23

Taking this doesn't appear to protect the taker. It prevents the taker from spreading the virus. The vaccine already kind of does that any way.   The people taking this likely are the same people taking the vaccine. The people who refuse to take the vaccine will likely refuse to take this.   People are the problem.

">The media has fear mongered so many issues that now the public reacts to anything they say with skepticism, even when they’re right.  Or, the media isn't actually the problem.  Rather, a lot of people are desensitized or ignore the real dangers in the world that the media reports.  Hurricanes are a great example of this.  Hurricane Dorian was a major category 5 hurricane that was tracking to directly hit Florida's east coast with winds as high in speed as 200 MPH.  Florida was helped in the 11th hour by steering currents that brought the storm north and east away from the peninsula.  The Bahamas on the other hand?  Not so fortunate, they suffered one of the worst natural disasters in their and the world's history.  Now, how did/have most Floridians reacted to Dorian's aftermath?  Basically by saying that it was a lot of overblown media hype.  ""It didn't actually hit us, so the news just kept making up a bunch of malarkey to scare us.""  The Bahamas are literally still in ruins and the attitude of most of the people who were very much in the crosshairs of that devastating storm believe that the media made too much of it.  And no, it's not a case of ""Florida man"" being crazy, it's complacency, and it happens to all people all the time.  Most big time disasters only affect one community or at most a region of the world, COVID-19 is one of the few times in my lifetime that people on a *global scale* are grappling with the same thing at the same time.  Hell, this exact type of outbreak was predicted by numerous experts both in the U.S. and globally.  Yet it was still exacerbated by wildly irresponsible decision making (disbanding the NSC pandemic response team) and disturbing levels of inaction (lack of testing) on the part of world leaders.

"Hi All,

First time poster, but a comment thread recently was super kind and helpful, so, here I am.

Because of certain scheduling things and upcoming travel I'm thinking about getting the flu shot early (as in today or tomorrow), and I'm wondering a couple of things. Tomorrow at 10 AM I have a dental cleaning (I have to get them every four months), not as bad as root planing but even maintenance ones can be intense and they sometimes I think use a kind of Ozone spray, if that affects anything.

Anyway, given the exposure to actual illnesses risks of going to the dentist, and that vaccines can make one feel run down, here are my questions:

1. Would getting the shot this afternoon be a terrible idea (sometime within the next five hours), given having to teach tonight and tomorrow morning's appointment? Not sure I can even schedule this.

2. Would getting the shot tomorrow early afternoon, after the dental cleaning, work better? I'm not sure immune system wise in what order to pile on, i.e. shot night before and cleaning after, or, shot hours after cleaning.

3. I'd rather not wait until Wednesday for the vaccine, but, would that be the actual best option?

4. Given everything *gestures broadly* this year's shot is still considered okay? I'm being repetitive, I've seen this question already asked on this forum, but I'm uneasy about whatever changes that may be being made that have nothing to do with health or science. I've seen comments to the effect of that next year's vaccines will be what's affected as opposed to this year's.

Thank you so much for reading and for any guidance ❤️",2025-08-19 4:09

"The recent emergence of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the subsequent vaccinations that followed highlight a very real problem in the United States, medical skepticism. While skepticism is important and productive for any society, especially among left, it can also hinder things like public health and progress. In a free society, it is vital to listen to why people hold the views that they do in hopes of better understanding how to move forward and achieve a society that works for all. Trust in institutions is at a low despite the advancements and achievements of modern medicine and science and understanding why this lack of trust exists is key to expanding the health of American society as a whole.
There are many reasons why some Americans remain skeptical of science and the medical field. One major reason includes the fact that many companies, including pharmaceutical companies, are driven by profit. According to one study, “pharmaceutical companies were viewed with deep distrust” (Jamison et al. 89). This is likely because they are viewed as valuing “profit over the needs of the public” (Jamison et al. 89). It is hard to argue with this fact considering pharmaceutical companies make tons of money through research and selling their products. Afterall, the United States is a capitalist country in which virtually every industry relies on profit to survive.
Another reason for medical skepticism may be the increased usage of social media among the American public. Americans are now more than ever getting their news and information from sites such as Facebook, Tiktok, and Twitter rather than more traditional methods such as television programs and the radio. These websites often fuel misinformation on both sides of the political aisle and may lead people down the track of conspiracies more so than factual, credible information. Although this is true, a bigger reason people fall for misinformation, is a lack of media literacy. As we all know, there is false news, and bad narratives on any form of media. Social media has many benefits for modern medicine, including the fact that “health care leaders” can “directly communicate with the public, sharing information that was traditionally relegated to medical journals and hospital video sessions” (Gottlieb & Dyer 640). This is extremely important, as social media allows science and medicine to be accessible to a larger number of people. However, social media “can” also “allow for virtual celebrities and influencers (both medical and nonmedical) to have a significant influence of information spread due to their number of followers, regardless of the accuracy of their information” (Gottlieb & Dyer 640-641). This is just one example of the harmful effect that social media can have on science and medicine. It highlights how the notion of internet celebrities can have a dire effect on the spread of information and misinformation. People may believe something that Nicki Minaj, for example, has said about the COVID-19 vaccine compared to the words and information spread by scientific agencies such as the CDC.
When exploring medical skepticism, it is important to examine the different groups that coexist in American society and how their trust levels differ. African Americans have many reasons to be skeptical of the American medical field. The United States has a history of discriminating against African Americans and other marginalized groups in virtually every aspect of life, including science and medicine. One study examining levels of trust in the influenza vaccine highlights these differences. According to this study which involved questioning both African Americans and White people regarding their trust in the influenza vaccine, “many African Americans voiced deep-seated distrust of the government’s motives”
(Jamison et al. 91). This can be (at least partially) explained by the history of the United States, including previous harm done to the African American community through things like forced sterilizations. Overall, “for many Whites, trust in government’s role in influenza vaccination is implicit and unquestioned” (Jamison et al. 93). This may be due to the fact that Whites lack the same history of oppression that is prominent for many other marginalized groups, including African Americans. It is important to note that this study was done prior to the COVID epidemic and that the results may differ if Americans were asked the same questions regarding the COVID vaccination.
Furthermore, it is important to explore why medical trust is so important. Trust may play a major role in whether a person seeks professional help for a medical issue. People often turn to alternative medicine when their trust in science and medical institutions is particularly low. It is certainly cause for concern if someone refuses to seek professional medical attention for themselves or their children. One study finds that “more trust in the medical profession” is “associated with following recommendations, relying on the judgment of physicians, seeking professional medical help, and granting increased control and decision making to the physician” (Trachtenberg et al. 348). This implies that trust in the medical field may be associated with taking the advice of medical professionals.

Finally, any discussion of trust in medicine and science should involve ways to move forward. The United States has become increasingly polarized and almost every issue is divided among party lines. This means that even issues that were previously not subject to politicization have become political and this includes science and medicine. This can be evidenced by the willingness of many liberals and the unwillingness of many conservatives to take the COVID-19 vaccination even when their jobs and livelihoods were on the line. However, one study offers promising results regarding partisanship and trust in scientific institutions such as WHO. It “shows that there is a partisan split in average trust in the WHO but that even the Republican and Independent respondents averaged a higher level of trust in the WHO than in their own governors” (Robinson et al. 1117). This means that scientific institutions still hold a level of trust that is higher than political actors. In order to move forward, it is important for scientific and medical institutions to regain their authority and dominance over scientific and medical issues and to lessen their association with politics. Likewise, these organizations should do what they can to rebuild trust with marginalized groups and the general public. There is still certainly work and research to be done to assess what the scientific and medical fields can do in order to rebuild their trust with the American public, however, examining why some people lack trust in these vital institutions is one step towards progress.",2022-12-28 14:29

"You're missing the point. A medical professional shouldn't lie because of the ""greater"" good. Not only is it not for the greater good, it's also actively not a part of medicine. Lying erodes public trust which can damage the efficacy of the overall system - see antivax as a symptom of it (yes, you can't solve the issue entirely ever but the point is to never push that envelope). It's also unethical for a medical practitioner to lie about the efficacy of the treatment. If he thought masks weren't useful he could say something like ""current research suggests X"" but the standards of modern medicine are to be very careful and lying even if you think it's for the greater good is unethical. Patient autonomy and the veracity of the information you give them are at the top of everything - they even come before treatment of the patients themselves. You might disagree with this but this is the current paradigm of modern medicine.  Also if diverting the supply chains necessitates 0 masks be delivered to the public, so be it. They have to make a conscious effort on how to allocate masks in this current scenario. They can't just throw out falsehoods because they think it makes the situation better (it doesn't, supply chain manipulation is always better at getting the desired result in this case).",2020-04-02 22:36

"I've got this intuition in life that, as a person, when you suffer for X time, it takes ""about as long"" to heal.   You get maybe 80% of the recovery in the first 20% of time, but there's this lingering tail that extends much further into the future after a crisis. Some things are too long so we ""live with it"", because the healing would take longer than our lifespan. And that's where there is possible transmission to generations, you know, in a very direct manner. We tend to want to finish the unfinished business of our parents, like we're trying to prove fate wrong as far as our family is concerned.  And that principle? It extends into generations: when a generation has suffered, a whole generation, then I observe in history that it takes about as long, i.e another generation, to heal. Only then can we really resume ""elevation"", progress, whatever you call a positive evolution in time.  When trauma is bigger than one generation, then you extend about as far into the future the consequences of that. I think the former Sovietic union is a good example that we have yet to see unfold entirely. It will undoubtedly produce very different societies 1, 2 generations down the road.   The ""Roms"" (a gypsy folk, not to be confused with Romanians) in Europe as well, they're a nomadic people that were often treated as slaves or pariahs; they've internalized it so much that young Roms do not have any other idea than basically looting the world around, they don't really consider themselves as humans on the same level, let alone citizens of any territory. They are animal to us just as we are animal to them, because a horrible strain of massive persecution by entire societies has imprinted this view into their deepest collective consciousness. It's not morals, it's survival at this point.  It's a fucking huge tragedy paved with atrocities (WWII etc), and honesly even starting now you don't see that problem corrected before 2050 at best. More like 2100 when all those who lived ""as slaves"" have died.   That's the true length of generations, and why historical time cannot be sped up much: it's really death that separates generations in terms of conducting civilization, not birth. Birth of children is the messenger, and death of parents is the message. When children hear that message, that's when they really take matters into their own hands, that's when they change society.  Ah, I'm rambling.  Here's the important conclusion: whenever we let trauma happen, it is psychological debt on our future. The terms of that debt — how long, how much — are function of the trauma. Once it's done, it's done, we can only pay the consequences.   That's why some societies / countries are so bent on spending every last available buck to prevent trauma of all kinds from happening, because whatever *good* you gained by not helping those in greater harm is always largely offset by the price you'll have to pay for that trauma, collectively, for years or generations to come.   We do the same thing exactly in our lives: we try not to keep skeletons in the closet, we try not to accumulate so much grief that we'd never be able to recover. Why is it so hard to understand that grief at a collective level is magnified and paralyzing collectively just the same way...",2020-03-26 19:20

Because it's not really a meaningful point.  I'll copy my reply to the person you were talking to so you see it.  Here's the reason.  This is sickness on top of everything else.  This virus is much more contagious than the flu and if tons of people get sick at once on top of the sick people from other things that need help it will overflow our hospitals and then decisions will have to be made to choose who lives and dies among people who would otherwise have lived if the hospitals were not overflowing and had the room and equipment to treat them.  Shutting everything down is an attempt to limit the spread so less people get sick at one time so hospitals can meet the capacity while purposefully extending the duration of people getting sick.,2020-03-24 1:12

I literally have had to remove family from my social media because of their anti-science rhetoric. Like. How are you going to make ANY argument against wearing masks in public in the middle of a global pandemic?,2020-07-04 17:11
"1. I can't see where they controlled for the SEQUENCE of the diagnosis & the vaccine(s) administered. Which came first? Like, if an UN-vaccinated kid is diagnosed with asthma at 6 months (or 2 years) of age, then the doc would recommend that s/he get a flu shot every year (because of this underlying risk factor). So when you find a correlation between vaccines & asthma, it's possible that ""asthma causes vaccination"" rather than the other way around.  2. It's interesting that the unvaccinated kids had far less follow-up, because they were not ""in the system"" as long as the vaccinated. I'm wondering if:  * unvaxxed kids got fired from the pediatric practices * unvaxxed kids moved away more for some reason? Like, indicating some social instability in the families? or * non-vaxxing was becoming more common as the study went on. So maybe the unvaxxed kids were born later, and were just younger on average when the study ended?   But any way you slice it, the unvaxxed had less time to have anything diagnosed. They did attempt to compensate for this, but that just made the resulting groups even smaller.   3. The obvious confounder in studies like this, is the healthcare-seeking behavior of the parents. Like, some kids cough a lot, and their parents don't take them to the doctor. Other kids (with similar severity of illness) are taken to the doctor and thus get the label of ""asthma."" And people who take their kids to the doctor more often, are more likely to get their kids the recommended vaccines. This may have to do with parental anxiety, their trust of doctors' recommendations (if I think doctors are idiots, then I'm unlikely to seek their opinion about my kid's cough) and even their access to transportation/ ability to take off work. So they SAY that they controlled for this factor, by excluding the kids who had ZERO visits. OK, but even among the kids who has between 1 & 500 visits, you would still expect that to be a confounding factor.   4a. It is weird that they divide the kids into ""unvaccinated"" and ""one or MORE"" vaccines. Like, why such a binary division? If you suspect a synergistic interaction between vaccines, then you wouldn't expect any problems from the one-vaccine kids, right? And if you had a big enough group (which I'm not sure they did) you could stratify people for ""1 to 9"" and ""10 to 19"" or whatever, AND stratify them for how MANY chronic conditions, and see if there's a smooth plot there. AND you could stratify to say WHICH vaccines, or which COMBINATIONS of vaccines, had the highest correlation with particular illnesses. I mean, there are many things in vaccine, right? And they might have unique effect. But that they went binary, so the findings are kind of limiting.  4b. Similarly, they evaluated kids as having ""one or more"" illness, rather than 1-2; and 2-3; 4or more; or whatever. Same limitations. They do at least comment specifically on the illness for which they found correlations.   5. There were many diagnoses that they couldn't comment on, because there were zero cases among unvaxxed kids. This just means your groups weren't big enough. But it's disappointing that they didn't give the raw data for how many cases of \[whatever\] there were among the vaccinated. Like, you can assume that the NEXT kid in the unvaxxed series (if your series had been bigger) would have had the condition, and then you can estimate that the disease is more common among the vaxxed by ""at least a factor of X."" <<< I can explain that better (I think🤔)",2025-09-16 22:33

It's an interesting theory, but nobody else believes that.  We are correctly deciding to sacrifice the entire economy - DESTROY IT - in order to save some lives.  I think it is the **correct** decision, it is important to save some COVID-19 lives to shut the entire economy down/off and choose to put every nail salon, restaurant, bar, beauty salon, travel related business, sports arena out of business forever.

No undocumented alien is getting 1 cent, they are about to starve to death including their undocumented children ages 5 years old and younger.  You probably think that is Ok, but I personally am bothered when children starve.  Recently it was decided Cruise Ship companies that registered in other countries - their employees should STARVE instead of getting any benefits to punish the owners of the companies for not registering the cruise ships in more expensive locations like the USA.  Yeah, starvation is coming.    We're picking the winners and losers, and some of the losers are going to starve to death.  I'm Ok with it, we needed to stop the virus so it was important to shut down the economy and sacrifice some of the poor people to starvation.  The philosophical question now is ""how long to keep the economy shut down and how many poor people should we sacrifice to starvation""?  Is it 6 months?  Or 12 months?  Or 10 years?  We can save the most COVID-19 patients if we keep the economy turned entirely off for 10 years or more, but the massive, massive starvation it will cause will be biblical.  I'm seriously not in favor of keeping the economy in ""off"" mode for more than 10 years.  You'll see cannibalism, and I'm not even kidding.

I'm quarantining  but I honestly wish I had not just done social distancing in public but just stayed home. unless it is essential to go out (or have people come in) just don't do it. why have regrets like me instead of just limiting all contact? if this is covid, I may have gotten it a couple weeks ago while traveling the US. or I could have gotten it a week ago when I knew better but still felt a little unclear due to peer pressure and boredom.",2020-03-23 21:31
You cannot sue anyone for this vaccine. Not the manufacturer nor the administrator. It’s shielded by the government and the prep act. Sorry this happened to you!,2021-06-12 20:45

They are preparing us for something bigger then just coronavirus.  Let's try h5n1/Sars-cov2. When this happens noone is safe. 60% mortality rate,2020-03-22 20:27
"It's weird, but Canada has that beat, a man was shot to death by police today over a mask dispute, after assaulting store employees and ramming the building with his truck. Over being told he can't come in without a mask. Over a fucking *mask* this guy wound up in an armed standoff with cops and was killed.    Boggles the mind.",2020-07-16 1:16
"That's intense! I'm sorry!   That is a known side effect, but it doesn't seem to happen often. I have been hearing that one of the mRNA shots has been kind of rough for people this time- I think the Pfizer, oddly (it's usually the Moderna that causes more intense side effects because of the dosage difference between the two.)   I have had 7 mRNA shots, nothing bad like that, but I have experienced nausea with some of them. It wasn't intense, but I struggled to eat for 24 hours with 2 shots.   I got Novavax this time, which is known for fewer side effects & is a more traditional style vaccine. I would recommend it for anyone who struggles with the mRNA shots.",2024-10-12 5:02
I hope you are all safe and well. I also hope little kids get the chance for their shots soon if able. I live in New England and can only imagine how much MORE stressed I'd be elsewhere in the States 😬,2021-08-01 20:59
"But to clarify, this is just for the Novavax, right? We can still get the mRNA vaccines? Asking because my mom has a compromised immune system after battling cancer twice so we all get vaccinated for EVERYTHING just in case. Ultimately, I'd rather not be accidentally responsible for killing her because some idiot hates science and decides his stupidity means I can't protect my family.",2025-05-19 8:54
I had the first Pfizer shot 3/31 and 2nd 5/22.  Noticed balding area early June and in the last 2 1/2 months lost 80% of my hair.  Blood tests normal no prior hair loss.  Hoping this is a Telogen effluvium event from vaccine and will eventually grow back but no new growth yet that I can see.  My first dermatologist said absolutely not the vaccine my second opinion I got said he's heard about 1/800 - 1/1000 have hair loss as side affect.  I'm not anti vaccine I just want an open and honest discussion about it so I can move forward and make informed decisions about future shots.,2021-08-25 4:08
"Sure dude.... stupidity, of which you are a prime example, is the other epidemic in addition to COVID. At least there's a vaccine for COVID.",2021-10-17 15:57
This is what people like You love.  There is no test to state that definitively.  What the vaccine and to a lesser extent Covid does is find “loaded guns” in your boy and fires them.  She may have had a predisposition but never developed these things without that damn poison injection.  So many have suffered and people like you gaslight and make them feel like they are nuts.  One day your time will come since I assume you are UTD on your boosters.  Let’s see what you have to say then because surely there will be no connection to the vax🙄,2024-06-04 12:48
"Mask in 2020 were for us to buy time to create the tools (vaccines) that would bring us to normalcy. We were waiting for something tangible and specific.  Since Covid is never going away, we’ve run out of tangible goals to wait for. We could say until we have full FDA approval or when under 12s get vaccinated, but that isn’t even where the conversation is centered. I doubt if we already vaccinated kids under 12 that the conversation would be any different. So what do we do when we offer immunity (vaccines) and we’re not satisfied with the number of people who took it? Mask indefinitely? Mask will stall spread but not offer immunity, those unvaccinated will be vulnerable still after the next mask mandate ends and so on. So what do we wait for?  Part of being an adult is making a plan, and that’s not what we have now with the notion of mask “until things are better”. What counts as better? Personally, I’m fine with normalcy returning when things are as good as they are going to get, even if it’s still not as safe as things were in 2019. Especially if the average person can take the vaccine and make things virtually as safe as before for themselves.",2021-08-01 12:43
"Good, last several times I went I got looked at like a crazy person for wearing a mask. Been avoiding shopping there",2020-07-15 19:24
"You are ignorant of the system. It is NOT the doctors and nurses (for the most part) that decide how much to charge you. It is (mostly) insurance companies, and to a lesser extent, hospitals/administration that decide this. We are simply cogs in a cogwheel.     I CAN say, if I wasn't paying off two mortgages each month, one for my house, and one for my medical school loans (they are very close to each other), then I would have more money to spend within the economy. I was just making this argument to my wife, when we were discussing what loans we should focus on trying to pay off next (her college loans, my college loans, or med school loans)",2020-05-07 0:09

"Make sure you get a good supply of N95s for the year, they'll help him a lot if most others aren't masking.  You might have to cut the elastic a little shorter and hot glue it back in place, if his head is smaller.  I feel like I'm a grown up version of your son, bad lungs, constant infections, scarring, etc. The earlier he gets used to doing what needs to be done to protect himself from future infections, the better.  Best of luck to him this year!",2021-08-01 18:25
